<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The two letters which bear the name of St. Peter
have from the earliest times met with very
different degrees of acceptance. The genuineness of
the First Epistle is attested by the unanimous voice
of primitive Christendom. As it is addressed to Christians
dwelling in different parts of Asia Minor, it is
natural to look for a knowledge of it in those countries.
And nowhere is it earlier noticed. Polycarp, Bishop
of Smyrna, a contemporary of the last surviving Apostle,
and whose martyrdom took place about the middle of
the second century, has repeated quotations from this
Epistle. It was known also to Papias (&#8224; 163), Bishop
of Hierapolis, and to Melito (170), Bishop of Sardis.
That it was known to the Greeks is seen from the
Epistle to Diognetus, which for a long time was attributed
to Justin Martyr (&#8224; 165), while the "Shepherd"
of Hermas, written at Rome, testifies that it was
known there also at about the same date. The inclusion
of it in the Peschito-Syriac Version bears
witness to its early circulation in the Eastern Church,
as also does its quotation in the writings of Theophilus
of Antioch (178). Heretics, no less than the faithful,
regarded it as a portion of authoritative Christian
literature. Basilides in Alexandria and the Marcosians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and Theodotus in Syria all knew of and cited this
Epistle. The Latin Church of Africa accepted it, as
we can see from a few quotations in Tertullian (&#8224; 218)
and a greater number in the writings of Cyprian (&#8224; 258).
In the Alexandrian Church it is often quoted by both
Clement (&#8224; 218) and Origen (&#8224; 254); while for Gaul we
have the testimony of the Church of Vienne in the
touching letter sent by the Christians there to their
"brethren in Asia and Phrygia" (177), and of Irenæus,
who was Bishop of Lyons shortly afterwards, and who,
coming from Asia to fill that see, is a witness both for
the East and the West. From the Christian Church
of the early centuries it is hardly possible to produce
stronger attestation.</p>

<p>But although so abundantly vouched for in ancient
days, the Epistle has not been exempt from the assaults
of modern criticism. Primitive Christendom regarded
St. Peter, St. John, and St. Paul as heralds of one and
the same Gospel, founded on the same promises,
strengthened by the same faith. They were at one
in what they taught and what they opposed. But
some modern thinkers, taking as a thesis that the
Gospel as set forth by the Apostle of the circumcision
differed widely from the doctrines of St. Paul, have
proceeded to make an eclectic Christian literature, out
of which the First Epistle of St. Peter has been rejected.
Its language is too much in harmony with accepted
writings of St. Paul. It can only have been compiled
by some later hand to promote the opinion that there
was no discord between the teachings of the first
Christian preachers. Moreover, it is inconceivable, they
consider, that a letter should be addressed by St. Peter
to the Christians in those very lands where the missionary
labours of St. Paul had been specially exerted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
where the converts were in a peculiar sense his "little
children."</p>

<p>Now in this first letter of St. Peter there is unquestionably
much that corresponds in tone with the
Epistle to the Romans, especially with the twelfth and
thirteenth chapters. In both letters Christians are
exhorted to offer their bodies as spiritual sacrifices,
to shun conformity with the world, to study to be
sober in mind, and to use duly all the gifts which they
possess; the same unfeigned love of the brethren is
inculcated, the same patience under suffering. Christians
are not to retaliate, but to overcome evil with
good; they are to be in subjection to all lawful
authority, and this for conscience' sake, to avoid all
excesses, rioting, drunkenness, chambering, and wantonness,
and to be ever looking forward to the coming of
the Lord.</p>

<p>In like manner there will be found numerous passages
in St. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians which
in spirit and tone greatly resemble the words of St.
Peter. At the very outset St. Paul addresses his
converts as "chosen of God in Christ before the
foundation of the world, that they should be holy
and without blemish before Him in love"; tells them
that they were "foreordained unto adoption as sons
through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure
of His will, to the praise and glory of His grace,
which He freely bestowed on them in the Beloved"
(Eph. i. 3-6). Similarly St. Peter writes to "the elect ...
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ," and presently
he adds that "according to God's great mercy they
were begotten again by the resurrection of Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Christ from the dead" (i. 1-3). In both epistles there is
the same teaching, the same election in love, the same
sonship, the same progress in holiness, the same free
gift through Jesus Christ. But in neither is there a
word that can be taken to militate against independent
authorship. And the same remark applies to all the
resemblances which exist between the two epistles in
the exhortations to servants, wives, and husbands; in
the commendations of humility, pity, courtesy; in the
entreaties to the believers to gird up the loins of
the mind and to lay aside all malice and hatred; in
those passages which speak of them as strangers and
pilgrims, as called from darkness to light, as being a
spiritual house, built upon Christ as the head corner-stone.
Of all these exhortations undoubted parallels are
to be found; but they are only evidence of the common
character which would pervade all the teaching of the
apostolic missionaries where the people addressed were
the same, the times not far apart, and the dangers and
temptations known alike to all the writers. Hence
parallels to St. Peter may be found in St. James too,
but they are no proof that the one Apostle (or, as some
critics say, some one writing under his name) copied
from the other.</p>

<p>Nor is it easy to see reason why St. Peter might not
be expected to write a letter to the congregations formed
first by St. Paul. No Evangelist or Apostle could publish
the message of the Gospel&mdash;that is, the life and
works&mdash;of Christ without telling of His chosen followers;
and amongst them, if our Gospels be a true picture,
St. Peter must ever have filled a prominent place. The
Churches in Asia assuredly had heard much of him,
and in a time of persecution or impending trial nothing
could be more fit than that the Apostle who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
most prominent amid Christ's companions should write
from Babylon or from Rome, it may be, where the
signs of the times would proclaim most clearly the
sufferings for which the Christian inhabitants of the
provinces should be prepared, to encourage the believers
in Asia to steadfastness and to remind them that
the same afflictions were being accomplished in their
brethren that were elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>This was likely enough even had St. Peter never
visited the districts to which his letter was addressed.
But we seem to find traces of him in Corinth (1 Cor.
ix. 5; cf. also xv. 5), and he certainly was not unknown
by name to the Christians of that city. And if so, why
need we question his journeying through Asia Minor?
And he was aware of the labours of his fellow-apostle.
From personal intercourse and discussion, especially in
connexion with the council at Jerusalem, he would be
sure that they were of one mind. It may be that he
had learnt something of St. Paul's letters to the Churches.
Under such circumstances it is not foreign to St. Peter's
character, nay rather quite in harmony with it, that he
should fulfil the Lord's command to "strengthen the
brethren"; that he should send them an earnest assurance
that, spite of sufferings and trials, this was the
true grace of God, in which they should rejoice to
stand.</p>

<p>But there are internal tokens in the Epistle which
seem more powerful evidence of its genuineness than
anything else. The writer calls himself "Peter, an
Apostle of Jesus Christ"; and he declares his personality
by touches and allusions which a forger would never
have fabricated. Thus he says, "All of you <em>gird
yourselves</em> with humility, to serve one another" (v. 5).
The verb which he employs here indicates a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
girding about with some towel or apron, which a slave
put on for doing some menial service. It is almost
impossible that the writer had not in his thoughts
the act of Christ when He gave His great lesson of
humility: "If I have washed your feet, ye ought also to
wash one another's feet."</p>

<p>So, too, the Master's exhortation, "Feed My sheep,"
"Feed My lambs," comes to mind as we read, "Tend
the flock of God which is among you, exercising the
oversight, not of constraint, but willingly" (v. 2). And
St. Peter's own words spoken in the house of Cornelius
are reproduced when the Father is declared to be One
"who, without respect of persons, judgeth according
to each man's work" (i. 17).</p>

<p>But it is in the allusions to Christ's passion and
resurrection, those events which marked the deep fall
and the rising again of St. Peter, that the personality
of the Apostle becomes most manifest. He has been
himself "a witness of the sufferings of Christ" (v. 1).
He can speak as an eye-witness of the Lord's death in
the flesh (iii. 18; iv. 1) and His quickening in the
spirit; can exhort men to courage because they are
partakers of the sufferings of Christ (iv. 13). Who
does not feel that the writer of the words, "Let them
also that suffer according to the will of God commit
their souls in well-doing unto a faithful Creator" (iv. 19),
is thinking of the scene on the cross, of the Saviour's
finished work, of the dying cry, "Father, into Thy hands
I commend My spirit"?</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking instance of this peculiarity,
this tendency to dwell on the events of the Passion, is
found in ii. 19-24. Speaking to servants, he argues,
"What glory is it if when ye sin and <em>are buffeted</em> for
it ye shall take it patiently?" And having used the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
word by which the Evangelists describe (Matt. xxvi. 67;
Mark xiv. 65) the insults heaped upon the Lord at His
trial, the writer is carried away in mind to the whole
scene: "He did no sin, neither was guile found in His
mouth; when He was reviled, He reviled not again;
when He suffered, He threatened not, but committed
Himself to Him that judgeth righteously; in His own
self He bare our sins in His own body upon the tree,
that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness,
by whose stripes ye were healed." And in
the last clause especially we see traces of one who had
been present through the painful history. The word
rendered "stripes" means "bruises" or "weals," such
as come from savage blows, and is just the word which
would occur to one who had seen the bruised body
taken down from the cross, but hardly to any one else.</p>

<p>Again, the writer makes you feel without quoting
that he has the words of Jesus constantly in his mind.
Thus in the exhortation, "Cast all your anxiety upon
God, for He careth for you" (v. 7); when he says, "If
ye are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are
ye" (iv. 14), or "Be sober; be vigilant" (v. 8), or
"Be sober unto prayer" (iv. 7), or commends "not
rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling, but
contrariwise blessing" (iii. 9), at each of the sentences&mdash;and
the letter abounds with examples&mdash;there rise in the
reader's mind some similar words of Christ, making
him feel that he is perusing a writing of one to whom
the Lord's language was abundantly familiar.</p>

<p>With the marks of personal character and associations
meeting us constantly, and with the unbroken
consensus of antiquity in favour of St. Peter's authorship,
we shall not lightly allow speculations about hypothetical
differences between the teaching of the Apostles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
of the Gentiles and of the circumcision to disturb our
acceptance of this letter for what it proclaims itself
to be: the work of the Apostle St. Peter, of one who
was himself a witness of the sufferings of Christ.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the Second Epistle the whole history is very
different. It appears to have been little known in the
early Church, and is included by Eusebius (330) among
the &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;, "books to which objection was raised"
as late as his day. It is true that in Clement of Rome
there is a sentence (Ep. i., chap. xi.) which many have
accepted as containing a clear allusion to the passage
(2 Peter ii. 6, 7) which speaks of Lot and the destruction
of Sodom. And if this could be demonstrated
with certainty, it would be most valuable testimony.
It would prove the Epistle to have been accepted at a
very early date and by the important Church in Rome.
But we have so far to go before we come upon any
other notice that the silence makes us doubtful of the
evidence from Clement. Moreover, such other witness
as we do find is not of a very direct character.
Firmilian, Bishop of Cæsarea, in Cappadocia, about
256 <small>A.D.</small>, in a letter of which a Latin version is preserved
among the writings of Cyprian, uses words which
probably indicate that he knew both the epistles of
St. Peter; but he gives no quotation. The Second
Epistle was no doubt meant for the same readers as
the First; and that is addressed, among others, to the
Christians of Cappadocia, so that there is no improbability
in supposing the letter to have been early
known there. Theophilus of Antioch (170) uses the
comparison of the word to a lamp shining in a dark
place in such a way as to give the impression that he
knew the Epistle, and a similar possible reference is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
found in the writings of Ephrem Syrus (&#8224; 378).
Palladius (400), who was a friend of Chrysostom, and
wrote at Rome, makes a clear allusion to 2 Peter; and
in the Apology of Melito, Bishop of Sardis, there is
a passage concerning the destruction of the world by
fire at the last day which is strikingly parallel to
2 Peter iii. 5-7, and can hardly have been written
without a knowledge of the Epistle.</p>

<p>This is a very small amount of early evidence, and
among the more voluminous writers of the first three
centuries we find no mention of the Epistle. We
cannot, therefore, be surprised that by Eusebius it is
classed among the works of less acceptance. But the
same fate befell larger and more important writings
than this Epistle. The Apocalypse and the Epistle
to the Hebrews stand in the same list in Eusebius.
And St. Peter's second letter has not the same general
interest as the first, and therefore is likely to have
been less widely circulated; and this is all that
Eusebius's classification means. The books were not
generally received because there was a less general
knowledge of their existence and history.</p>

<p>But when the Church entered on the settlement of
the New Testament Canon at the Council of Laodicæa
(366), the Second Epistle of St. Peter was accepted;
and no doubt there was evidence then before the
assembled Fathers which time has now destroyed.
Yet in the letter itself there are points which no doubt
weighed with them, and which are patent to us as they
were then. The writer claims to be St. Peter, an
Apostle and the writer of a previous epistle. He
speaks solemnly of his death as near at hand; and
still more solemn, when viewed as evidence, is the
declaration that he had been one of the witnesses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
Christ's transfiguration. It is almost inconceivable
that a forger, writing to warn against false teachers,
writing in the interest of truth, should have thus
deliberately assumed a name and experience to which
he had no claim. These statements must have influenced
the opinion of the Laodicæan Council, and we
know that they did not act on light evidence; they did
not on the strength of a name accept into their canon,
but excluded, works at the time widely circulated and
passing for histories or letters of some of the Apostles.</p>

<p>Moreover, when we consider the kind of teaching
against which St. Peter's epistle is directed, it is
difficult to place it anywhere except at about the same
date as St. Paul's epistles. It speaks of the "fables"
(&#956;&#8166;&#952;&#959;&#953;, i. 16), the groundless, baseless fancies, of the
early heretics in the same manner which we find in
St. Paul (cf. 1 Tim. i. 4; iv. 7). The same greed and
covetousness (&#960;&#955;&#949;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#958;&#8055;&#945;) is noted by both the Apostles
in the teachers against whom their voice is raised
(cf. 2 Peter ii. 3; 1 Tim. vi. 5; Titus i. 11). There
are the same beguiling promises of liberty (cf. 2 Peter
ii. 19; 1 Cor. x. 29; Gal. v. 13), a perversion of the
freedom of which St. Paul speaks so much to the
Galatian converts; and just as he warns against "false
brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to
spy out our liberty" (Gal. ii. 4), so does St. Peter
condemn those "who privily bring in heresies of
destruction" (2 Peter ii. 1). With so many common
features in the two pictures, we can scarcely be wrong
in referring them to the same times. No other period
in early Church history suits the language of St. Peter
so well as the few years before his martyrdom. The
First Epistle may be dated eight or ten years earlier.</p>

<p>There is another morsel of evidence from the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
Testament which is worth notice. St. Peter describes
the heretics against whom he writes as following the
error of Balaam the son of Beor, and notes this among
the tokens of their covetousness. In the Apocalypse
(ii. 14, 15) the same people are described, and in the
same terms, but with an addition. They have received
a definite name, and St. John terms them several times
over "the Nicolaitanes." Such a distinctive title marks
a later date than St. Peter's descriptive one, which is
drawn from the Old Testament. The Apocalypse was
assuredly written before the destruction of Jerusalem.
If then we may take the mention of the Nicolaitanes
by that designation as an indication of a later date than
2 Peter, we are again brought to the time to which we
have already referred the Epistle: some time between
68 and 70 <small>A.D.</small></p>

<p>Considerable discussion has arisen about the passages
in 2 Peter which are like the language of St. Jude.
There can be no doubt that either one Apostle copied
the words of the other, or that both drew from a
common original. But this point, in whatever way it
be settled, need not militate against St. Peter's authorship.
It is nothing unworthy of the Apostle, if he find
to his hand the words of a fellow-teacher which will
serve his need, to use what he finds. Nay, the letter
itself tells us that he was prepared to do this. For he
refers his readers (iii. 15) to the writings of St. Paul
for support of his own exhortations. St. Peter's seems,
however, to be the earlier of the two epistles, if we
compare his words, "There <em>shall be</em> false teachers,
who <em>shall bring</em> in heresies of destruction," etc. (ii. 1),
with St. Jude, who speaks of these misleading teachers
as already existent and active: "There <em>are certain
men crept in</em> unawares"; "<em>These are</em> spots now existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
in the feasts of charity"; "<em>They are feasting among the
brethren</em> without fear." And St. Jude seems clearly
to be alluding to St. Peter's words (2 Peter iii. 3) when
he says, "Remember ye the words which were spoken
before of the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, how
that they told you there should be <em>mockers</em>" (&#7952;&#956;&#960;&#945;&#8150;&#954;&#964;&#945;&#953;)
"in the last time." This word for "mockers" is found
only in St. Peter's epistle. It is nowhere else in the
New Testament; and while St. Peter's words are a
direct utterance, St. Jude's are a quotation.</p>

<p>But there are two or three features of resemblance
between the style of St. Peter's first epistle and the
second which support strongly the genuineness of the
latter. The First Epistle has a large proportion of
words found nowhere else in the New Testament.
There are a score of such words in this short composition.
Now the Second Epistle presents us with the
same peculiarity in rather larger abundance. There
are twenty-four words there which appear in no other
New Testament writing. It seems to have been a
peculiarity of the writer of both letters to use somewhat
uncommon and striking words. Now take the
Second Epistle to have been the work of an imitator.
He would be sure to notice such a characteristic, and
sure also to repeat, for the sake of connexion, some
distinctive expressions of the first letter in the second.
But the case is much otherwise. There is the same
abundance of unusual words in both epistles, but not
a single repetition; the same peculiarity is manifest,
but displays itself in entirely new material. This is
an index of authorship, not of imitation.</p>

<p>There are one or two differences between the two
epistles which in their way are of equal interest. The
first letter was one of encouragement and consolation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
the second is full of warning. Hence, though the
coming of the Lord is dwelt on alike in the two, in the
former it is set forth as a <em>revelation</em> (1 Peter i. 5), as a
day for which believers were looking, and in which
their hopes would be realised, and their afflictions at
an end; in the second letter the same event is called
a coming (&#960;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#8055;&#945;), an appearing, a presence, but one
which will usher in the great and terrible day of the
Lord, and be the prelude of judgement to them that
have fallen away.</p>

<p>Again, the sufferings of Christ are a theme much
dwelt on in the First Epistle, where they are pointed to
as the lot which Christians are to expect, and the Lord
is the pattern which they are to imitate; in the Second
they are hardly noticed. But was there not a cause for
such reticence? Was it a time to urge on men the
imitation of Christ when the danger was great that
they would deny Him altogether?</p>

<p>No doubt many other points of evidence, which are
lost to us, were presented to the Fathers of the
Laodicæan Council, and with the result that the Second
Epistle of St. Peter was received into the Canon side
by side with the first. But the three centuries of want
of acknowledgement have left their mark on its subsequent
history, and many earnest minds have treated
it as of less authority than other more accepted portions
of the New Testament. Among these is Luther, who
speaks of the First Epistle as one of the noblest in the
New Testament, but is doubtful about the claims of
the Second. Similar was the judgment of Erasmus and
of Calvin.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, go back to the evidence produced
at Laodicæa. Time has swept that away, but, while
doing so, has left us the result thereof; and the acceptance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
of the Epistle by the Fathers there assembled will
be judged by most men to stand in lieu of the evidence.
No court of law would permit a decision so authenticated
and of such standing to be disturbed or overruled.</p>

<p>And we ourselves can observe some points still
which draw to the same conclusion. The letter harmonises
in tone with the other New Testament writings,
and some of its linguistic peculiarities are strikingly in
accord with the universally accepted letter of St. Peter.
We are therefore not unwilling, though we have not
the early testimony which we could desire, and though
the primitive Church held its genuineness for doubtful,
to believe that ere this second letter was classed with
the other New Testament writings these doubts were
cleared away, and would be cleared away for us could
we hear all the evidence tendered before those who
fixed the contents of the Canon.</p>

<p>The discovery last year in Egypt of some fragments
of the Gospel and Apocalypse once current under the
name of St. Peter has drawn attention once more to
the genuineness and authenticity of the Second Epistle
in our canon. But the difference in character between
it and these apocryphal documents is very great.
The Gospel ascribed to Peter seems to have been
written by some one who held the opinion, current
among the early heretics, that the Incarnation was
unreal, and that the Divine in Christ Jesus had no
participation in the sufferings at the Crucifixion.
Hence our Lord is represented as having no sense of
pain at that time. He is said to have been deserted by
His "power" in the moment of death. The stature of
the angels at the Resurrection is represented as very
great, but that of the risen Christ much greater. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
these peculiar features may be added the response
made by the cross to a voice which was heard from
heaven, the cross having followed the risen Christ
from the tomb. In the fragments of the Apocalypse
we have a description of the torments of the wicked
utterly foreign to the character of the New Testament
writings, in which the veil of the unseen world is rarely
withdrawn. The circumstance and detail given in the
apocryphal fragment to the punishments of sinners
mark it as the parent of those mediæval legends of
which the "Visions of Furseus" and "St. Patrick's
Purgatory" afford well-known examples.</p>

<p>The study of these fragments, of which the Gospel
may be dated about 170 <small>A.D.</small>, sends us back to the
contemplation of the Second Epistle of St. Peter more
conscious than before at what a very early date
errors, both of history and doctrine, were promulgated
among the Christian societies, while at the same time
we are impressed more strongly with the sense that
the accord of the Second Epistle with Gospel history,
where it is alluded to, as well as the simplicity of
Christian doctrine which it enforces, mark it as not
unworthy of that place in the Canon which was
accorded to it in the very earliest councils which dealt
with the contents of New Testament Scripture.</p>

<h3><em>THE WORK OF THE TRINITY IN MAN'S ELECTION
AND SALVATION</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Peter, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect who are sojourners
of the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification
of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus
Christ: grace to you and peace be multiplied."&mdash;<span class="smcap">1 Peter</span> i. 1, 2.</p></blockquote>


<p>"When thou art converted, strengthen thy
brethren" (Luke xxii. 32), was the Lord's injunction
to St. Peter, of which this Epistle may be
considered as a part fulfilment. So richly stored is it
with counsel, warning, and consolation that Luther, the
conflicts of whose life will bear some comparison with the
trials of these Asian converts, calls it one of the most
precious portions of the New Testament Scriptures. Its
value is further enhanced because in so many places the
Apostle reverts in thought or word to his own life-history,
and draws his teaching from the rich stream of
personal experience. Even the name which he sets at
the head of the letter had its lesson in connexion with
Jesus. Most Jews took a second name for profaner
use in their commerce with the heathen; but to Simon,
the son of Jonas, Peter must have been a specially
sacred name, must have served as a watchword both to
himself and to all others who had learnt the story of its
bestowal and the meaning which was bound up with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>That a letter by St. Peter should be, as this is, of a
very practical character is no more than we might
expect from what we know of the Apostle from the
Gospels. Prompt in word and action, ever the spokesman
of the twelve, he seems made for a guide and
leader of men. What perhaps we should not have expected
is the very definite doctrinal language with which
the Epistle opens. Nowhere in the writings either
of St. Paul or St. John do we find more full or more
instructive teaching concerning the Holy Trinity. And
herein St. Peter has been guided to choose the only
order which tends to edification. Sound lessons for
Christian life must be grounded upon a right faith, and
a brother can afford no strength to his brethren unless
first of all he point them clearly to the source whence
both his strength and theirs must come.</p>

<p>Of the previous intercourse between St. Peter and
those to whom he writes we can only judge from the
Epistle itself. The Apostle's name disappears from
New Testament history after the Council of Jerusalem
(Acts xv.), but we feel sure his labours did not cease
then; and though the first message of Christianity
may have been brought to these Asiatic provinces by
St. Paul, the allusions which St. Peter makes to the
trials of the converts are such as seem impossible had
he not himself laboured among them. The frequent
reminders, the special warnings, could come only from
one who knew their circumstances very intimately.
Allusions to the former lusts indulged in in their days
of ignorance, to the reproaches which they now have to
suffer from their heathen neighbours, to their going
astray like lost sheep, are a few of the unmistakable
evidences of personal knowledge.</p>

<p>He writes to them as <em>sojourners of the dispersion</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
In the minds of the Jews this name would wake up
sad memories of their past history. It told of that
great break in the national unity which was made by
the tarrying in Babylon of so many of the people at
the time of the return, then of those painful periods
in later days when their nation, as the vassal now of
Persia, now of Greece, of Egypt, of Syria, and of Rome,
was made the sport of the world-powers as they rose
and fell, times in which Israel could see few tokens
of the Divine favour, could hear no voice of the prophet
to encourage or to guide. But now to those who had
accepted the Gospel of Christ those dark years would
be seen to have been in no wise barren of blessing and
of profit. The scattered Jews had carried much of their
faith abroad among the nations; schools of religious
teaching had arisen; the chosen people in their dispersion
had adopted the language best known among the
other nations; and thus the outcome of those sorrowful
times had been a preparation for the Gospel. Proselytes
had been made in the countries of their exile, and a wider
field opened for the Christian harvest. The dispersion
of Israel had been made, as it were, a bridge over which
the grace of God passed for publishing the glad tidings
of the Gospel, and to gather Jew and Gentile alike into
the fold of Christ.</p>

<p>But it would be a mistake to restrict the word
"dispersion" here to the Jewish converts. The Apostle
speaks more than once in his letter to those who had
never been Jews, to men who (i. 14) had been fashioned
according to their former lusts in ignorance; who had
in times past (ii. 10) no share with God's people; who
(iv. 13) had wrought the will of the Gentiles, walking
in lasciviousness, lusts, and abominable idolatries. To
these too since their conversion the name "dispersion"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
might be fitly applied. They were but a few
here and there among the multitudes of heathendom.
And their acceptance of the faith of Jesus must have
given to their lives a different aspect. It must often
be so with the faithful. Their life is from the world
apart. It must have been specially thus with these
Christians in Asia. They could be verily only strangers
and sojourners; their true home could never be made
among their heathen surroundings. As the Jew in old
days sighed for Jerusalem, so their hope was centred
on a Jerusalem above.</p>

<p>Yet God had a mission for them in the world. This
is a special portion of St. Peter's message. As the
scattered Jews of old had opened a door for the spreading
of the Gospel, so the Christians of the dispersion
were to be its witnesses. Their election had made
them a peculiar people; but it was that they might show
forth the praises of Him who had called them out of
darkness into His marvellous light, and that by their
good works the heathen might be won to glorify God
when in His own time He should visit them too with
the day-star from on high.</p>

<p>But beside the words which speak of severance and
pilgrimage, the Apostle uses one of a different character.
With that large charity and hope which is stamped
upon the whole of the New Testament, he calls these
scattered Christian converts the <em>elect</em> of God. Just as
St. Paul so often includes whole Churches, even though
he find in them many things to blame and to reprove,
under the title of "saints" or "called to be saints," so
it is here. And the sense of their election is intended to
be a mighty power. It is to bind them wherever they
may be scattered into one communion in Christ Jesus.
Through the world they are dispersed, but in Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
they constitute a great unity. And the sense of this
is to lift their hearts above any sorrowing for their
isolation in the world. For through Christ they have
(i. 4) an inheritance, a home, a claim of sonship; and
their salvation is ready to be revealed in the last
time.</p>

<p>Later generations have witnessed much unprofitable
controversy round this word "election." Some men
have seen nothing else in the Bible, while others have
hardly acknowledged it to be there at all. Then some
have laboured to reconcile to their understandings the
two truths of God's sovereignty and the freedom of
the human will, not content to believe that in God's
economy there may be things beyond their measure.
St. Peter, like the other New Testament writers, enters
on no such discussions. Whether amid the full assurance
of newly quickened faith the first Christians found
no room for intellectual difficulties, or whether the
spirit within them led them to feel that such questions
must ever be insoluble, we cannot know; but it is
instructive to note that the Scripture does not raise
them. They are the growth of later days, of times
when Christianity was wide-spread, when men had lost
the feeling that they were strangers and pilgrims of the
dispersion, and were no longer prepared to welcome,
with St. Peter and St. Paul, every Christian brother
into the number of God's chosen ones, counting them
as those who had been called to be saints.</p>

<p>Of the election of believers the Apostle here speaks
in its origin, its progress, and its consummation. He
views it as a process which must extend through the
whole life, and connects its various stages with the
Three Persons of the Trinity. But, with the same
practical instinct which has already been noticed, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
enters on no statements about the nature of the
Godhead in itself; he neither discusses what may be
known of God, nor how the knowledge is to be obtained.
He says no word to intimate that the mention of three
Persons may be difficult to understand in co-relation
to the unity of the Godhead. Such inquiries exercise
the mind, but can hardly further, what was St. Peter's
special aim, the edification and comfort of the soul.
That result comes from the inward experience of what
each Person of the Godhead is to us, and on this the
Apostle has a lesson. He makes plain for us the share
which Father, Son, and Spirit bear in the work of
human salvation. Christians, he teaches us, are elect,
chosen to be saints, according to the foreknowledge of
God the Father; the election is maintained when their
lives are constantly hallowed by the influence of the
Holy Ghost; while in Christ they have not only an
example of perfect obedience after which they must
strive, but a Redeemer whose blood can cleanse them
from all the sins from which the most earnest strivings
will not set them free. Of these things the Christian
soul can have experience. It is thus that the life of the
elect believer begins, grows, and is perfected.</p>

<p>It begins <em>according to the foreknowledge of God the
Father</em>. Here St. Peter may be his own interpreter.
In his sermon on the day of Pentecost he employs the
same word, "foreknowledge," and he is the only one
who uses it in the New Testament. There (Acts ii. 23)
he says that Christ was delivered up to be crucified by
the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
And on the same subject in this very chapter (i. 20)
he speaks of Jesus as <em>foreknown</em>, as a Lamb without
spot and blemish before the foundation of the world.
In these passages we are carried back beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
ages into the Divine council-chamber, and we find
the whole course of human history naked and open
before the eyes of the All-seeing. God knew even
then what the history of the human race would be,
saw that sin would find an entrance into the world, and
that a sacrifice would be needed, if sinners were to be
redeemed. Yet He called the world and its tenants
into being, and provided the ransom in the person of
His only Son. Why this was well-pleasing unto Him
it is not ours to discuss; whether for the uplifting of
humanity by providing an opportunity for moral obedience
or for the greater manifestation of His infinite
love. But whatever else is mysterious, one thing is
plain: the counsel of the Holy One is seen to be
a counsel of mercy and of love; and though its
operation may not seldom be perplexing to our finite
powers, the Apostle teaches us that this determination
from all eternity was made with infinite tenderness.
He tells us it was the ordinance of our Father. The
beginning and the end thereof are hidden from us.
We learn only a fragment of His dealings during the
brief period of a human life. But men may rest content
with the proof of their election in the sound of the
Gospel message which they hear. They who are thus
called may count themselves for chosen. This call is
the Divine testimony that God is choosing them. Concerning
His intention towards others who may seem
to have passed away without hearing of His love, or
who are living as though no loving message of glad
tidings had ever been proclaimed, we must rest in
ignorance, only assured that the Eternal God is as
truly their Father as we know Him to be ours.</p>

<p>To limited human knowledge the course of the
world has ever been, must ever be, full of darkness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
perplexities. Men gaze upon it as they do upon the
wrong side of a piece of tapestry as it is woven. To
such observers the pattern is always obscure, many a
time quite unintelligible. For full knowledge we have
to wait to the end. Then the web will be reversed,
God's designs and their working comprehended; we
shall know even as we are known, and, with hearts and
voices tuned to praise, shall cry, "He hath done all
things well." Of such a revelation the poet (Shelley,
<cite>Adonais</cite>, Stanza lii.) sings, a revelation of the all-seeing,
unchanging Jehovah and of the glorious enlightenment
that shall be in His presence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"The one remains, the many change and pass;</div>
<div class="line">Heaven's light for ever shines, earth's shadows fly:</div>
<div class="line">Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,</div>
<div class="line">Stains the white radiance of eternity,</div>
<div class="line">Until death tramples it to fragments."</div>
</div></div>

<p>In this wise would St. Peter have us think of the
grace of election. It has its beginning from our Father;
its fulfilment will also be with Him. The measure
and the manner of its bestowal are according to His
foreknowledge, according to the same foreknowledge
which provided in Christ an atonement for sin, which
appointed Him to die, and that not for some sinners
only, but for the sins of the whole world.</p>

<p>But in the call according to God's foreknowledge the
believer is not perfected. He must live worthily of his
calling. And as his election at the first is of God, so
the power to hold it fast is a Divine gift. He who
would rejoice over God's election must feel and constantly
foster within himself <em>the sanctification of the
Spirit</em>. To be made holy is his great need. This
demands a life of progress, of renewal, a daily endeavour
to restore the image which was lost at the Fall. "Be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
ye holy, for I am holy," is a fundamental precept of both
Old and New Testaments; and it is a continual admonition,
speaking unto Christians that they go forward.
Under the Law the lesson was enforced by external
symbols. Holy ground, holy days, holy offices, kept
men alive to the need of preparation, of purification,
before they could be fit to draw near unto God or for
God to draw near unto them.</p>

<p>For us there is opened a more excellent way: the
inward, spiritual cleansing of the heart. Christ has
gone away where He was before, and sends down to
His servants the Holy Ghost, who bestows power that
the election of the Father may be made sure. Hence
we can understand those frequent exhortations in the
epistles, "Walk in the Spirit"; "Live in the Spirit";
"Quench not the Spirit." The Christian life is a
struggle. The flesh is ever striving for the mastery.
This enemy the believer must do to death. And as
aforetime, so now, sanctification begins with purification.
Christ sanctifies His Church, those whom He has
called to Him out of the world; and the manner is by
cleansing them through the washing of water with the
word. Here we gladly think of that sacrament which
He ordained for admission into the Church as the
beginning of this Divine operation, as the wonted
entrance of the Holy Ghost for His work of purifying.
But that work must be continued. He is called
"holy" because He makes men holy by His abode
with them. And Christ has described for us how this
is brought to pass. "He shall take of Mine," says
our Lord, "and shall show it unto you. All things that
the Father hath are Mine" (John xvi. 14, 15). Every
good gift, which the Father who calls men hath, the
Spirit is sent to impart. The words speak of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
gradual manner of its bestowal; all things may be
given, but they are given little by little, as men can or
are fit to receive them. He shall take a portion of
what is Mine, is the literal meaning of the Evangelist's
phrase (John xvi. 15). The plural phrase &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#8005;&#963;&#945;
&#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953; &#8001; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#8052;&#961; marks the boundless supply, the singular
&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7952;&#956;&#959;&#8166; &#955;&#8053;&#956;&#968;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; the Spirit's choice of such a
portion therefrom as best suits the receiver's needs
and powers. In this wise men may become gradually
conformed to the image of Christ, grow more and more
like Him day by day. More and more will they drink
in of the whole truth, and more and more will they be
sanctified.</p>

<p>In this daily enlightenment must God's faithful ones
live, a life whose atmosphere is the hallowing influence
of the Holy Ghost. But it is to be no mere life of
receptivity, with no effort of their own. The Apostle
makes this clear elsewhere, when he says, "Sanctify
the Lord God in your hearts" (iii. 15)&mdash;make them
fit abodes for His Spirit to dwell in; lead your lives
in holy conversation, that the house may be swept and
garnished, and you be vessels sanctified and meet for
the Master's use.</p>

<p>Thus chosen by the Father and led onward by the
Spirit, the Christian is brought ever nearer to the full
purpose of his calling: <em>unto obedience and the sprinkling
of the blood of Jesus Christ</em>. The Christ-pattern which
the Spirit sets before men is in no feature more striking
than in its perfect obedience. The prophetic announcement
of this submission sounds down to us from the
Psalms: "Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God"; and
the incarnate Son declares of Himself, "My meat is to
do the will of Him that sent Me, and to finish His
work": and even in the hour of His supreme agony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
His word is still, "Father, not My will, but Thine,
be done." Specially solemn, almost startling, is the
language of the Apostle to the Hebrews when he says
of Jesus that "He learned obedience by the things
which He suffered," and that "it became the Father, in
bringing many sons unto glory, to make Christ, the
Captain of their salvation, perfect through suffering."
With the Lord as an example, obedience is made the
noblest, the New Testament form of sacrifice.</p>

<p>But when such obedience was connected with the
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus, the Jews among
St. Peter's converts must have been carried in thought
to that scene described in Exod. xxiv. There, through
Moses as a mediator, we read of God's law being made
known to Israel, and the people with one voice promised
obedience: "All the words which the Lord hath
said will we do, and be obedient." Then followed a
sacrifice; and Moses took the blood and sprinkled it
on the people, saying, "Behold the blood of the
covenant which the Lord hath made with you concerning
all these words"; and the Lord drew nigh
unto His people, and the sight of the glory of the Lord
on Mount Sinai was like devouring fire in the eyes of
the children of Israel.</p>

<p>For Christians there is a Mediator of a better
covenant. We are not come unto the mount that
burned with fire, but unto Mount Zion (Heb. xii. 18-22).
In that other sacrament of His own institution, our
Lord makes us partakers of the benefits of His passion.
With His own blood He constantly maketh His people
pure, fitting them to appear in the presence of the
Father. There at length the purpose of their election
shall be complete in fulness of joy in the sight of Him
who chose them before the foundation of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus does the Apostle set forth his practical, profitable
lessons on the work of the Trinity in man's
election and salvation; and he concludes them with
a benediction part of which is very frequent in the
letters of St. Paul: <em>Grace to you and peace</em>. The early
preachers felt that these two blessings travelled hand
in hand, and comprised everything which a believer
could need: God's favour and the happiness which is
its fruit. Grace is the nurture of the Christian life;
peace is its character. These strangers of the dispersion
had been made partakers of the Divine grace.
This very letter was one gift more, the consolation of
which we can well conceive. But St. Peter models
his benediction to be a fitting sequel to his previous
teaching. <em>Grace</em>, he says, <em>to you and peace be multiplied</em>.
The verb "be multiplied" is only used by him
here and in the Second Epistle, and by St. Jude, whose
letter has so much in common with St. Peter's.</p>

<p>In this prayer the same thought is with him as when
he spake of the stages of the Christian election. There
must ever be growth as the sign of life. Let them
hold fast the grace already received, and more would
be bestowed. Grace for grace is God's rule of giving,
new store for what has been rightly used. This one
word of his prayer would say to them, Seek constantly
greater sanctification, more holiness, from the Spirit;
yield your will to God in imitation of Jesus, who
sanctified Himself that His servants might be sanctified.
Then, though you be strangers of the dispersion,
though the world will have none of you, you shall be
kept in perfect peace, and feel sure that you can trust
His words who says to His warfaring servants, "Be
of good cheer; I have overcome the world."</p>

<h3><em>THE HEAVENLY INHERITANCE</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
according to His great mercy begat us again unto a living hope by
the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance
incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in
heaven for you, who by the power of God are guarded through faith
unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. Wherein ye
greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, ye have
been put to grief in manifold temptations, that the proof of your faith,
being more precious than gold that perisheth, though it is proved by
fire, might be found unto praise and glory and honour at the revelation
of Jesus Christ: whom not having seen ye love; on whom,
though now ye see Him not, yet believing, ye rejoice greatly with
joy unspeakable and full of glory: receiving the end of your faith,
even the salvation of your souls."&mdash;<span class="smcap">1 Peter</span> i. 3-9.</p></blockquote>


<p>"Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
speaketh," words true of all this letter, but of
no part more true than of the thanksgiving with which
it opens. The Apostle recalls those dark three days
in which the life he bore was worse than death. His
vaunted fidelity had been put to the proof, and had
failed in the trial; his denial had barred the approach
to the Master whom he had disowned. The crucifixion
of Jesus had followed close upon His arrest, and
Peter's bitter tears of penitence could avail nothing.
He to whom they might have appealed was lying in
the grave. The Apostle's repentant weeping saved
him from a Judas-like despair, but dreary must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
been the desolation of his soul until the Easter morning's
message told him that Jesus was alive again.</p>

<p>We can understand the fervency of his thanksgiving:
<em>Blessed be God, which hath begotten us again by the
resurrection of Christ from the dead</em>. No better image
than the gift of a new life could he find to describe the
restoration that came with the words of the angel from
the empty tomb, "He is risen; go your way: tell His
disciples and Peter that He goeth before you into
Galilee." The Lord forgave His sinning, sorrowing
servant, and through this forgiveness he lived again,
and bears printed for ever on his heart the memory of
that life-giving. The very form of his phrase in this
verse is an echo from the resurrection morning:
<em>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ</em>.</p>

<p>Only in a few passages resembling this in St.
Paul's epistles<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is God called "the God of our Lord
Jesus Christ." But Peter is mindful of the Lord's own
words to Mary, "Go unto My brethren and say unto
them, I ascend unto My Father and your Father, and
My God and your God" (John xx. 17); and now that
he is made one of Christ's heralds, the feeder of His
sheep, he publishes the same message which was the
source of his own highest joy, and which he would
make a joy for them likewise. That God is called
theirs, even as He is Christ's, is an earnest that Jesus
has made them His brethren indeed. To the doctrine
of their election according to the foreknowledge of the
Father he now adds the further grace which couples
the Fatherhood of God with the brotherhood of Christ.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p>That these gifts are purely of God's grace he also
implies: <em>He begat us again</em>. Just as in natural birth
the child is utterly of the will of the parents, so is it
in the spiritual new birth. <em>According to God's great
mercy</em> we are born again and made heirs of all the
consequent blessings. This passage from death unto
life is rich, in the first place, in immediate comfort.
Witness the rejoicing amidst his grief which St. Peter
experienced when he could cry to the Master, "Lord,
Thou knowest all things: Thou knowest that I love
Thee." But the new life looks for ever onward. It
will be unbroken through eternity. Here we may taste
the joy of our calling, may learn something of the
Father's love, of the Saviour's grace, of the Spirit's
help; but our best expectations centre ever in the future.
The Apostle terms these expectations a lively, or rather
<em>a living, hope</em>. The Christian's hope is living because
Christ is alive again from the dead. It springs with
ever-renewed life from that rent tomb. The grave is
no longer a terminus. Life and hope endure beyond
it. And more than this, there is a fresh principle of
vitality infused into the soul of the new-born child of
God. The Spirit, the Life-giver, has made His abode
there; and death is swallowed up of victory.</p>

<p>In continuing his description of the living hope of
the believer, the Apostle keeps in mind his simile of
Fatherhood and sonship, and gives to the hope the
further title of <em>an inheritance</em>. As sons of Adam, men
are heirs from their birth, but only to the sad consequences
of the primal transgression. Slaves they are,
and not free men, as that other law in their members
gives them daily proof. But in the resurrection of
Jesus the agonised cry of St. Paul, "Who shall deliver
me?" (Rom. vii. 24), has found its answer. Christians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
are begotten again, not to defeat and despair, but
to a hope which is eternal, to an inheritance which will
endure beyond the grave. And as in their spiritual
growth they are ever aspiring to an ideal above and
beyond them, in respect of the saintly inheritance they
have a like experience. They begin to grasp it now
in part, and have even here a precious earnest of the
larger blessedness; they are sealed by the Holy Spirit
of promise and marked as the redeemed of God's own
possession (Eph. i. 13, 14). But that which shall be
is rich with an exceeding wealth of glory; Christ
keeps the good wine of His grace to the last.</p>

<p>How beggared earthly speech appears when we
essay by it to picture the glory that shall be revealed
for us! The inheritance of the Christian's hope
demands for its description those unspeakable words
which St. Paul heard in paradise, but could not utter.
The tongues of men are constrained to fall back upon
negatives. What it will be we cannot express. We
only know some evils from which it will be free. It
shall be <em>incorruptible</em>, like the God and Father (Rom.
i. 23) who bestows it. <em>Eternal</em>, it shall contain within
it no seed of decay, nothing which can cause it to
perish. Neither shall it be subject to injury from without.
It shall be <em>undefiled</em>, for we are to share it with
our elder Brother, our High-priest (Heb. vii. 26), who
is now made higher than the heavens. Earthly possessions
are often sullied, now by the way they are
attained, now by the way they are used. Neither spot
nor blemish shall tarnish the beauty of the heavenly
inheritance. It shall <em>never fade away</em>. It is amaranthine,
like the crown of glory (1 Peter v. 4) which the
chief Shepherd shall bestow at His appearing; it is as
the unwithering flowers of paradise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor are these the only things which make the
heavenly to differ from the earthly inheritance. In this
life, ere a son can succeed to heirship, the parent
through whom it is derived must have passed away;
while the many heirs to an earthly estate diminish, as
their number increases, the shares of all the rest.
From such conditions the Christian's future is free.
His Father is the Eternal God, his inheritance the
inexhaustible bounty of heaven. Each and all who
share therein will find an increase of joy as the number
grows of those who claim this eternal Fatherhood, and
with it a place in the Father's home.</p>

<p>St. Peter adds another feature which gives further
assurance to the believer's hope. The inheritance is
reserved. Concerning it there can be no thought of
dwindling or decay. It is where neither rust nor moth
can corrupt, and where not even the archthief Satan
himself can break through to steal. There needs no
preservation of the incorruptible and undefiled, but it
is especially kept for those for whom it is prepared.
He who has gone before to make it ready said, "I go
to prepare it for you." The Apostle has made choice
of his preposition advisedly. He says, &#7952;&#953;&#962; &#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;on
your behalf; for your own possession. The inheritance
is where Christ has gone before us, in heaven, of
which we can best think, as Himself hath taught us,
as the place "where He was before" (John vi. 62), the
Father's house, in which are many mansions. There
it is in store, till we are made ready for it.</p>

<p>For the present life is only a preparation-time. Ere
we are ready to depart we must pass through a probation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
God suffers His beloved ones to be chastened,
but He sends with the trial the means of rescue. They
are <em>guarded</em>. The word which St. Peter here uses is
one applicable to a military guard, such as would be
needed in the country of an enemy. God sees what
we stand in need of. For we are still in the territory
of the prince of this world. But mark the abundant
protection: <em>by the power of God through faith</em>. The
Apostle's language sets our guardianship forth under
a double aspect. The Christian is "in" (&#7952;&#957;) "the power
of God." Here is the strength of our wardship. Under
such care the believer is enabled to walk amid the trials
of the world unscathed. Yet the Divine shield around
him is not made effective unless he do his part also.
Through faith the shelter becomes impregnable. The
Christian goes forward with full assurance, his eyes
fixed on the goal of duty which his Master has set
before him, and, heedless of assailants, perseveres in
the struggles which beset him. Then, even in the
fiercest fires of trial, he beholds by his side the Son of
God, and hears the voice, "It is I; be not afraid."</p>

<p>Thus to the faithful warfarer the victory is sure.
And to this certainty St. Peter points as he continues,
and calls the heavenly inheritance a <em>salvation</em>. This
will be the consummation. "Sursum corda" is the
believer's constant watchword. The completed bliss
will not be attained here. But when the veil is lifted
which separates this life from the next, it is ready to
be manifested and to ravish the sight with its glory.
The sense of this salvation ready to be revealed nerves
the heart for every conflict. By faith weakness grows
mighty. Thus comes to pass the paradox of the
Christian life, which none but the faithful can comprehend:
"When I am weak, then I am strong";<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
"I can do all things through Christ, that giveth me
power."</p>

<p>Hence comes the wondrous spectacle, which St. Peter
was contemplating, and which amazed the heathen
world, exceeding joy in the midst of sufferings.
<em>Wherein ye greatly rejoice</em>, he says. Some have
thought him to be referring to a mental realisation of
the last time, about which he has just spoken, a realisation
so vivid to the faith of these converts that they
could exult in the prospect as though it had already
arrived. And this exposition is countenanced in some
degree by words which follow (ver. 9), where he
describes them as now receiving the end of their faith,
even the salvation of their souls.</p>

<p>But it seems less forced to consider the Apostle as
speaking with some knowledge of the circumstances of
these Asian Christians, a knowledge of the trials they
had to undergo, and how hope was animating them to
look onwards towards their inheritance, which was but
a little while in reversion, towards the salvation which
was so soon to be revealed. Full of this hope, he says,
ye greatly rejoice, though ye have had many things
to suffer. Then he proceeds to dwell on some of the
grounds for their consolation. Their trials, they knew,
were but for a little while, not a moment longer than
the need should be. Their sorrow would have an end;
their joy would last for evermore.</p>

<p>The form of St. Peter's words,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> it is true, seems to
imply that there must always be the need for our chastening.
And what else can the children of Adam expect?
But it is He, the Father in heaven, who fixes both the
nature and the duration of His children's discipline.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Some men have felt within themselves the need of
chastisement so keenly that they have devised systems
for themselves whereby they should mortify the flesh,
and prepare themselves for the last time. But of self-appointed
chastenings the Apostle does not speak.
Of such the converts to whom he writes had no need.
They <em>had been put to grief in manifold temptations</em>.</p>

<p>We can gather from the Epistle itself some notion of
the troublous life these scattered Christians had amid
the crowd of their heathen neighbours. They were
regarded with contempt for refusing to mingle in the
excesses which were so marked a feature of heathen
life and heathen worship. They were railed upon as
evil-doers. They suffered innocently, were constantly
assailed with threatenings, and passed their time oft in
such terror that St. Peter describes their life as a fiery
trial.</p>

<p>Yet in the word (&#960;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#8055;&#955;&#959;&#962;) which he here employs to
picture the varied character of their sufferings we seem
to have another hint that these did not fall out without
the permission and watchful control of God Himself.
It is a word which, while it tells of a countless variety,
tells at the same time of fitness and order therein.
The trials are meted out fitly, as men need and can
profit by them. The Master's eye and hand are at
work through them all; and the faithful God keeps
always ready a way of deliverance. In this wise does
St. Peter proclaim that the putting to grief may be
made unto us a dispensation of mercy. Himself
had been so put to grief by the thrice-repeated question,
"Lovest thou Me?" (John xxi. 17). But a way was
opened thereby for repentance of his triple denial, and
that he might thrice over be entrusted with the feeding
of Christ's flock. Such was the putting to grief of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Corinthian Church (2 Cor. vii. 9) by St. Paul's first
letter, for it wrought in them repentance, so that they
sorrowed after a godly sort. And such sorrow can
exist side by side with, yea be the source of, exceeding
joy. The Apostle of the Gentiles is a witness when he
says that he and his fellow-labourers are "sorrowful,
yet alway rejoicing" (2 Cor. vi. 10).</p>

<p>The Christian does not allow troubles to overwhelm
him. The very comparison which St. Peter here
institutes, speaking though it does of a furnace of trial,
bears within it somewhat of consolation. Gold that is
proved by the fire loses all the dross which clung about
it and was mingled with it before the refining. It
comes forth in all its purity, all its worth; and so shall
it be with the believer after his probation. The things
of earth will lose their value in his eyes; they will fall
away from him, neither will he load himself with the
thick clay of the world's honours or wealth. The ties
of such things have been sundered by his trials, and
his heart is free to rise above the anxieties of time.
And better even than the most refined gold, which, be it
never so excellent, will yet be worn away, the faith of
the believer comes forth stronger for all trial, and he
shall hear at the last the welcome of the Master,
"Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord," the joy which
He bestows, the joy which He shares with those that
follow Him.</p>

<p>This is the revelation of Jesus Christ of which St.
Peter speaks. This is the praise which through His
atonement His servants shall find, and shall become
sharers of the glory and honour which the Father has
bestowed upon Him. To Christ then turns every
affection. <em>Whom not having seen ye love.</em> This is the
test since Christ's ascension, and has the promise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
special blessing. To His doubting Apostle Christ
vouchsafed the evidence he desired, for our teaching as
well as for his; but He added therewith, "Blessed
are they which have not seen and yet have believed."
And their joy is such as no tongue can tell. Not for
that are they silent in their rejoicing; their hearts
overflow, and their voices go forth in constant songs
of praise. But ever there remains with them the sense,
"The half has not been told."</p>

<p>For faith anticipates the bliss which God hath
prepared for them that love Him, and enters into the
unseen. The Holy Spirit within the soul is ever
making fuller revelation of the deep things of God.
The believer's knowledge is ever increasing; the eye-salve
of faith clears his spiritual vision. The thanksgivings
of yesterday are poor when considered in the
illumination of to-day. His joy also is glorified. As
his aspirations soar heavenward, the glory from on
high comes forth, as it were, to meet him. By gazing
in faith on the coming Lord, the Christian progresses,
through the power of the Spirit, from glory to glory;
and the ever-growing radiance is a part of that grace
which no words can tell. But so true, so real, is the
sense of Christ's presence that the Apostle describes it
as full fruition. Believers <em>receive even now the end of
their faith, the salvation of their souls</em>. So assured does
He make them of all which they have hoped for that
they behold already the termination of their journey,
the close of all trial, and are filled with the bliss which
shall be fully theirs when Christ shall come to call His
approved servants to their inheritance of salvation.</p>

<h3><em>THE UNITY AND GLORIOUSNESS OF THE PLAN
OF REDEMPTION</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched
diligently, who prophesied of the grace that <em>should come</em> unto you:
searching what <em>time</em> or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
which was in them did point unto, when it testified beforehand the
sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow them. To
whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto you, did
they minister these things, which now have been announced unto
you through them that preached the Gospel unto you by the Holy
Ghost sent forth from heaven; which things angels desire to look
into."&mdash;<span class="smcap">1 Peter</span> i. 10-12.</p></blockquote>


<p>The message of the Gospel unlocks the treasures
of Old Testament revelation. Evangelists and
Apostles are the exponents of the prophets. The
continuity of Divine revelation has never been broken.
The Spirit which spake through Joel of the pentecostal
outpouring had spoken to men in the earlier days, to
Abraham, Jacob, Moses, and David, and was now shed
forth upon the first preachers of the Gospel, and
bestowed abundantly for the work of the newly founded
Church of Christ. St. Peter, himself a chief recipient
of the gift, here proclaims the oneness of the whole of
revelation; and more than this, he bears witness to the
oneness of the teaching of the whole body of Christian
missionaries. St. Paul and his fellow-labourers had
spread the glad tidings first of all among these Asian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
converts; but there is no thought in St. Peter's mind
of a different gospel from his own. Those who
preached the Gospel to them in the first instance were,
even as himself, working in and by the same Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>In the preceding verses of the chapter the thoughts
of the Apostle have been dwelling on the future, on
the time when the hope of the believer shall attain its
fruition, and faith shall be lost in sight. He now turns
his glance backward to notice how the promise of
salvation has been the subject of revelation through
all time. To those among the converts who had studied
the Jewish Scriptures such a retrospect would be fruitful
in instruction. They would comprehend with him
how the truths which they now heard preached had
been gradually shadowed forth in the Divine economy.
That first proclamation of the seed of the woman to
be born for the overthrow of the tempter, but who yet
must Himself be a Sufferer in the conflict, was now
become luminous, and in outline presented the whole
scheme of redemption. The study of the development
of that scheme would beget a full trust in their hearts
for the future as they contemplated the stages of its
foreshadowing in the past.</p>

<p><em>Concerning which salvation</em>, he says, <em>the prophets
sought and searched diligently</em>. The Divine revelation
could only be made as men were able to bear it, and
the sentences of old must needs be dark. At first
God's love was set forth by His covenants with the
patriarchs. Then the wider scope of mercy was proclaimed
in the promises given to Abraham and repeated
to his posterity. In their seed, it was declared, not
the chosen race alone, but all the nations of the earth,
should be blessed. Here all through the history was
ground enough for diligent searching among the faithful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
How could these things be, Abraham solitary and
aged, Isaac's sons at feud with each other, Jacob and
his posterity in captivity? Even at their best estate
these seemed little fitted for the destiny which had
been foretold to them. But throughout the Mosaic
history some clung to their faith, and their great leader
foresaw that the promise would be fulfilled in its time
through One of whom he was but a feeble representative.
But to so wide a vision only a few attained.</p>

<p>In the evil days which followed, the hope of the
people must often have dwindled down; but yet at
times, as to Gideon's diminished army, it was made
manifest that the Lord could do great things for His
people: and the thought of the seed of the woman
promised as a Deliverer lingered in many hearts, and
enabled them to sing in thankfulness how the adversaries
of the Lord should be broken in pieces, how out
of heaven the Lord should thunder upon them, and
prove Himself the Judge of all the ends of the earth,
giving strength unto His king and exalting the horn
of His anointed. In such wise the prophetic teaching,
which had advanced from the blessing of an individual
to the choice and exaltation of a chosen family, was
expanded in the noblest spirits to the conception of a
kingdom of God among all mankind, and assumed a more
definite form when the promise was made to the Son of
David that His throne should be established for ever.</p>

<p>But how imperfectly God's design was comprehended
by the best among them we can see from the last
words of David himself (2 Sam. xxiii. 1-7). In them
we have an instance of the searching which must have
occupied other hearts beside that of the king of Israel.
The Spirit of the Lord had spoken by him, and a
promise of future glory had been made, when all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
should be brightness, every cloud dispersed. But the
vision tarried. The house of David was not so with
God. Yet he still held firmly to the everlasting
covenant, ordered in all things and sure, a covenant
of salvation, though as yet God made it not to grow.
David may be numbered among those <em>who prophesied of
the grace that should come</em> hereafter; and his words are
shaped by a power above his own, to suggest the advent
of Him who was to be the "dayspring from on high."</p>

<p>He and the other enlightened Israelites who have
left us their thoughts and aspirations in the Psalter
felt that the history of the chosen people was from first
to last a grand parable (Psalm lxxviii. 2), and that the
present could always be learning from the leading and
discipline of the past. The miracles and the chastisements
which they recite were all tokens of the sure
promise, tokens that the people were not forgotten, but
constantly aided by instruction, warning, and reproof.
So that another psalmist, though still searching for the
fuller meaning of the parables and dark sayings through
which he was conducted, could sing, "God shall redeem
my soul from the hand of the grave, for He shall take
me" (Psalm xlix. 15). There is a confidence in the
words, a confidence enough to sustain amid many trials.
To such a man the present was not all. There was a
life to come where God should be and rule, and his
heart had not seldom gone forth to the questioning <em>at
what time and in what form</em> the promises should be
fulfilled. Like Abraham, such men had seen the day of
Christ in vision and rejoiced over it, and the <em>Spirit of
Christ was within them</em> to sustain them. But the things
which they had heard and known, and of which their
fathers had told them, supplied cause for deep searchings
as <em>to the time and the manner of time unto which the</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<em>Spirit pointed</em>. The strength of the Lord and His
wondrous works were to be rehearsed to the coming
generations, that among them the hope might live, by
them the searching be continued. And as time went
on the vision was widened, for in no small number of
the Psalms we find the promised blessedness described
as the portion not of Israel only, but through Israel
grace was to be extended to the ends of the earth.
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands," is
no solitary invocation.</p>

<p>And when we turn to those prophets whose writings
we possess, we recognise that in them the Spirit of
Christ was working and pointing forward to the coming
redemption. But long before the days of Isaiah and
Micah the Spirit of the Lord had come mightily upon
His servants, and that picture of a glorious future
which both those seers have given to us was not
improbably the utterance of some earlier servant of the
Lord: "It shall come to pass in the last days that the
mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in
the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above
the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it" (Isa. ii. 2;
Micah iv. 1). Thus far had they attained, but the
search was not ended. "The last days"! When these
should come was known to God alone; and they spake
only as they were moved by Him, standing on their
towers of spiritual elevation, hearkening what the Lord
would say to them, and delivering His message with
all the fulness they could command. But they were
sure of the final bliss.</p>

<p>Of the same character are those words of Joel, which
St. Peter quoted in his sermon on the day of Pentecost,
"It shall come to pass <em>afterward</em>" (ii. 28). Beyond
this was not yet revealed. But it was the voice of God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
which spake through the prophet: "In those days I
will pour out My Spirit." And the Divine voice spake
of visitations of another kind. It <em>testified beforehand of
the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow
them</em>. We feel sure that here St. Peter had in mind
Isa. liii., which the New Testament has taught us to
apply in its fullest sense to our blessed Lord.</p>

<p>But the language of St. Peter in this clause deserves
special notice. He does not use the ordinary words
by which the personal sufferings of Christ would
generally be expressed, but he says rather, "the sufferings
which pertain unto Christ." And here we may
well consider whether the variation of phrase be not
designed. St. Paul uses the simple direct expression
(2 Cor. i. 5), and so does St. Peter himself (1 Peter iv.
13); and in those passages the Apostles are speaking
of the sufferings of Christ as shared by His people.
It would almost seem as if St. Peter's phrase in the
verse before us were intended to convey this sense
more fully. The sufferings pertain unto Christ, were
specially borne by Him; but they fall also upon those
who are, and have been, His people, both before and
after the Incarnation.</p>

<p>Those prophecies of Isaiah which speak of the
sufferings of the servant of the Lord had long been
expounded as meant of the Jewish nation, and with
such interpretation St. Peter was doubtless familiar.
Hence may have come his altered phrase, capable of
being interpreted, not only of Christ Himself, but of the
sufferings of those who, like these Asiatic converts,
were for the Lord's sake exposed to manifold trials.
This double application of the words, to Christ and to
His servants also, explains, it may be, the unique use
of the word "glories" in the clause which follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the sufferings of Christ and the <em>glories</em> that should
follow them. For the glories may be taken to signify
not only that honour and glory which the Father has
given unto Christ, but also the glory in which they
shall share who have taken up their cross to follow
Him. Nowhere else in the New Testament does this
plural word occur. To draw a sense like this from it
would minister no small comfort to the Christians in
their trials; and just before St. Peter has described
the joy which they should experience as "glorified,"
or "full of glory" (ver. 8). In like manner St.
Paul speaks (Rom. viii. 18) of the sufferings of this
present time as not worthy to be compared with the
glory that shall be revealed in us in the resurrection.</p>

<p>It would also serve as consolation to the sufferers,
who were thus pointed on to the future for Christ's
best gifts, to know that a similar forward glance had
been the lot of the prophets under the ancient dispensation.
One here and there had felt, as Malachi
(iii. 1), that the Lord whom they were seeking was
soon to come; but we know of none before the aged
Simeon to whom it had been made known that they
should not die till they had seen the Lord's Christ. To
the former generations <em>it was revealed</em>, says the Apostle,
<em>that not unto themselves, but unto you, did they minister
these things</em>. They beheld them, and greeted them, but
it was afar off. They spake often one to another
of a bliss that was to come; yet though praying,
longing, and hoping for it, they saw it only with the
eye of faith. The psalmists supply many illustrations
of this forward projection of the thoughts which dwelt
on the Messianic hope. Thus in Psalm xxii. 30, 31,
while rejoicing over his own rescue from suffering, the
speaker recognises that this is but a foreshadowing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
another suffering and another deliverance, even the
sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow.
"It shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation.
They shall come; they shall declare His righteousness
to a people that shall be born, that He hath done it,"
and again in another place, "This shall be written for
the generation to come, and a people which shall be
created shall praise the Lord" (Psalm cii. 18). And
these anticipations are ever coupled with the thought of
the wider extension of the kingdom of God, with the time
when "all the ends of the world shall remember and turn
unto the Lord," "when the nations shall fear the name
of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth His glory."</p>

<p>But the things which prophets and psalmists
ministered <em>have now been announced unto you through
them that preached the Gospel unto you</em>. You, St. Peter
would say, are now not heirs expectant, but possessors
of the blessings which former ages of believers foresaw
and foretold, just as in his pentecostal address he
testifies, "This is that which was spoken by the
prophet Joel." And those who have preached these
glad tidings unto you, he continues, have not done so
without warrant. They are joined by an unbroken
link to the prophets who went before them. In those
the Spirit of Christ wrought at such times as He found
fit instruments for raising a little the veil that lay over
the purposes of God. The preachers of the Gospel
have the same Spirit, and speak unto you <em>by the Holy
Ghost sent forth from heaven</em>. These (and of St. Peter
is this specially true) had witnessed the sufferings of
Christ, and been made partakers of the glories of the
outpoured Spirit. The promise of the Father had
been fulfilled to them, and they had received a mouth
and wisdom which their adversaries were not able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
resist. The risen Lord, the assurance of a life to
come, the guidance by the Spirit into all truth&mdash;these
were now realities for them, and were to be made real
for the rest of the world by their testimony.</p>

<p>And that he may further magnify that salvation
which he has been describing as published in part
under the Law and now assured by the message of the
Gospel, he adds, <em>which things angels desire to look
into</em>. Of the whole Divine plan for man's redemption
the angels could hardly be cognisant. Of God's love for
man they had been made conscious, had been employed
as His agents in the exhibition of that love, both under
the old and under the new covenant. Their ministry,
we know, was exercised in the lives of Abraham and
Lot; they watched over Jacob and over Elijah in their
solitude and weariness. One of their host was sent to
deliver Daniel and to instruct the prophet Zechariah.
At a later day they, who stand above mankind in the
order of creation, and are pure enough to behold the
presence of the Most High, were made messengers to
announce how the Son of God had deigned to assume,
not their nature, but the nature of humanity, and would
by His suffering lift up the race from its slavery to sin.
They proclaimed the birth of the Baptist, and brought
the message of the Annunciation to the Blessed Virgin.
They heralded the birth of Christ to the shepherds of
Bethlehem, and a multitude of their glorious company
sang the song of glory to God in the highest. They
tended the God-Man at His temptation, strengthened
Him in His agony, were present at His sepulchre, and
gave the news of the Resurrection to the early visitants.
Nor were their services at an end with Christ's ascension,
though they were present on that occasion also.
To Cornelius and to Peter angels were made messengers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and our Lord has told us that their rejoicing is great
over even one sinner that repenteth.</p>

<p>These immortal spirits whose home is before God's
throne, and whose great office is to sing His praise, yet
find in those ministrations to mankind in which they
have been employed matter for admiration, matter
which kindles in them fervent desire. They long to
comprehend in all its fulness that grace which they are
conscious God is shedding forth upon mankind. They
would scan<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> all the workings of His love and His
forbearance towards sinners. These things are to them
a subject of admiration, even as was the empty tomb of
Jesus to the disciples after the Resurrection; and from
their high estate the angelic host would fain stoop down
to gaze their fill upon what God's goodness has
wrought and is working out for mankind. They feel
that this knowledge would add a new theme to the
songs around the throne, would give them still greater
cause to extol that grace which manifests its noblest
features in showing mercy and pity.</p>

<p>And if such be the aspiration of angels, sinless beings
who feel not the need of rescue, shall the tongues of
men be dumb, men who know, each from the
experience of his own heart, how great is the evil of
sin in which they are entangled, how hopeless without
Christ's death was their deliverance from its thraldom;
who know how constant and how undeserved is the
mercy of which they are partakers, how true to
Himself God has been in their case? "I am Jehovah;
I change not: therefore ye children of men are not
destroyed."</p>

from the doctrines of election and of the future glory
in heaven. Such glorious privileges cannot be looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
forward to without awakening a sense of corresponding
duties, and for these he would not have them unprepared.
<em>Wherefore</em>, he says, because you have the
assurance of what the best men of old only dimly
foresaw, <em>girding up the loins of your mind, be sober</em>.
The Apostle has in mind the words of his Master,
"Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps
burning; and be ye yourselves like unto men looking for
their lord" (Luke xii. 35, 36). The advent of the bridegroom
may be sudden; those who would be of his train
must be prepared for their summons. To be girt in
body is a token of readiness for coming duty. And
St. Peter's figure would speak more forcibly to Eastern
ears than it does to ours. Without such girding the
Oriental is helpless for active work, the encumbrance of
his flowing robes being fatal to exertion. The heart of
the Christian must be untrammelled with the cares, the
affections, the pleasures of the world. He must be
free to run the race which lies before him, as was the
well-girt prophet who ran before the royal chariot to
the entrance of Jezreel.</p>

<p>And the Christian life is no light care, as St. Peter
pictures it. First, he says, <em>Be sober</em>. To train the
mind to exercise self-restraint is no easy duty at any
time, but specially in a season of religious excitement.
We know how converts in the very earliest
days of Christianity were carried into excesses both
in action and in word; and in every age of quickened
activity some have been found with whom freedom
degenerated into licence, and emotion took the
place of true religious feeling. The Jewish converts
in the provinces of Asia might be tempted to despise
those who still clung to the ancient faith, while
some of those who had been won from heathenism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
might by their conduct alienate rather than win their
brethren in Christ. We gather what was the nature
of the peril when we find the Apostle (iv. 7) urging
this sobriety as a frame of mind to be cultivated even
in their prayers, and St. Paul in his advice to Timothy
combining the exhortation to sobriety with "Suffer
hardship; do the work of an evangelist" (2 Tim. iv. 5).
It is the frame of mind meet for the maintenance of
sound doctrine, utterly opposed to those itching ears
which are only satisfied with teaching according to
their own lusts. Fitly therefore does our Apostle add
to his first exhortation a second which will make the
believers steadfast: <em>Set your hope perfectly on the grace
that is to be brought unto you</em>. In those early days this
counsel was not always easy to follow. There were
many enticements to wavering, many trials which made
the firm hold on strong faith difficult to maintain. And
with the "perfectly" must be combined that other
sense of the word "to the end." The hope must be
perfect in its nature, unshaken in its firmness, persuaded
of the certainty of the future grace, and strengthened
in that persuasion by the experience of the present
working of the Spirit. But the language of the Apostle
almost anticipates the future. He says not so much
that the grace is "to be brought," but rather that it is
even now "being brought" near and coming ever
nearer; for the revelation of Jesus Christ is progressive.
Though we learn something, it is only so much
as teaches us that there is more still to learn of the
boundless stores of grace. But as in a former verse
he spake of believers as having already by faith their
salvation in possession, even such is his language here.
And mark his lesson on the free gift of God s grace.
It is not a blessing to which the believer can attain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
his own power. He can hope for it; he can feel
assured that God in His own time will bestow it.
But whenever it comes, either as present grace to help
in trial, or future grace which shall be revealed, it is
given, brought, bestowed; and its full fruition will
only be reached <em>at the revelation of Jesus Christ</em>. But
assuredly these words may be applied to this life as
well as to the next. He who said, "The Holy Spirit
shall take of Mine and declare it unto you," designs to
be ever more and more revealed in the hearts of His
followers. His grace is being brought to them day by
day, and trains continually unto obedience those who
have been sprinkled with His blood.</p>

<p>And this obedience is the next precept for which
they are to be made ready by the girding up of the
loins of their minds, <em>as children of obedience</em>, the
obedience not of slaves, but of sons. Children they
are become by virtue of the new birth, and obedience
it is which gives them a claim upon God's Fatherhood.
They must seek for the docility and trustfulness of the
childlike character; they must accept a law other than
their own wills, having taken upon them the yoke of
Christ and aiming, in the light of His example, to become
worthy of being reckoned among His true followers.</p>

<p>When they contemplate their own lives, they must
feel that a mighty change is needed from what they
were aforetime. St. Peter's words mark the completeness
of the needed change: <em>not fashioning yourselves
according to your former lusts</em>. In time past they had
sought no further for a guide and pattern than their
own perverted desires; now they must school themselves
to say, "Do with me as Thou wilt, for I am
Thine." And He whose grace has begotten them again
will help them to frame their lives by His rule, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
have them learn of Him. But while the Apostle dwells
on the difference which must come over the lives of
these converts, mark the wondrous charity with which
he alludes to their former life in error. <em>In the time of
your ignorance</em>, he says. Even here he follows the
example of the Lord, who prayed in His agony,
"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
do." Sin blinds the moral and the mental vision too,
and men so blinded sink deeper and deeper into the
slough, while he who has learnt Christ has gained
another source of light. But, to raise the ignorant, they
must be taught; and tenderness makes teaching most
effective, and charity dictates the apostolic words. So
St. Paul at Athens to those who worshipped an
unknown God offered instruction to win them from
their ignorance, and pointed them to a God whose
offspring they were, and to whose likeness they might
be conformed.</p>

<p>Just so does St. Peter; <em>Like as He who called you is
holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living</em>.
This has been God's call from the first day until now,
but what a hopeless height is this for the sinner to aim
after, holy as God is holy! Yet it is the standard
which Christ sets before us in the Sermon on the
Mount: "Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is
in heaven is perfect." And why does He propose to
us that which is impossible? Because with the command
He is ready to supply the power. He knows
our frailty; knows what is in man both of strength and
weakness. At the same time He proclaims to us by
this command what God intends to make of us. He
will restore us again to His own likeness. That which
was God's at first shall be made God's once more.
The marred image, on which not even the superscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
can be traced, shall again be revealed in full
clearness, and the believer purged from all the defilements
of sin by the grace and help of Him who says,
"Be ye perfect," because He loves to make us so.</p>

<p><em>Because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy.</em>
This command comes down to us from the earliest days
of the Law. But in those old times it could not be said,
<em>in all manner of living</em>. These words betoken the
loftier standard of the New Testament. The patriarchs
and prophets and the people among whom they lived
were trained, and could only be trained, little by little.
Even in the best among them we cannot hope for
holiness in all manner of living. It was only by the
types and figures of external purification that their
thoughts were directed to the inner cleansing of the
heart, and long generations passed before the lessons
were learnt. The full sense of the Fatherhood of God
was not attained under the Law, nor did men under it
learn fully to live as children of obedience, children of a
Father who loves and will succour every effort which they
make to walk according to His law. The Incarnation
has brought God nearer to man, and on this relationship
of love the Apostle grounds his further exhortation.</p>

<p><em>And if ye call on Him as Father, who without respect
of persons judgeth according to each man's work, pass the
time of your sojourning in fear.</em> But the fear which
St. Peter means is a fear which grows out of love, a
fear to grieve One who is so abundant in mercy. Who
can call on God as Father but the children of
obedience? About the Father's will and His power to
make you holy there need be no fear. He has called
men and bidden them strive after holiness. The way
is steep, but they will not be unattended. What fear
then of failing to attain the goal? For the Father will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
also be the Judge. And here is the ground for eternal
hope and thankfulness, which the Apostle expresses in
words akin to those which he used in the house of
Cornelius: "Now I see that God is no respecter of
persons, but in every nation he that feareth God and
worketh righteousness is accepted with Him." Yes,
this is the fear which God looks for, not a paralysing
dread which checks all effort and kills out all hope.
Our Judge knows that our work will be full of faults,
but fear of Him must nerve us to make the endeavour.
It is not what men do, the feeble sum of their performance,
that He regards. The way, the spirit, the motive,
from which it is wrought&mdash;these will be the ground of
our Father's judgement. Hence the Gospel is a message
for all the world alike. The poor and lowly, to whom
no great deeds are possible, may through it live a life
of hope. It is not great gifts poured into the treasury
from an abundant store that have value in His eyes,
but the gifts which come with a heart's sacrifice&mdash;these
are precious indications, and receive the blessing, "They
have done what they could." And God's children are
to look on their life as no more than a brief pilgrimage.
It is a time of sojourning, in which the small occurrences
are of little account.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Earth is to the Christian,
what Egypt was of old to the Hebrews, no home, but
a place of trial and oppression of the enemy. God will
bring His children forth, even as He did of old. But
the dread to be most entertained is lest the many
attractions should, like the flesh-pots of the history,
win the affection of the pilgrims, and make them not
unwilling to linger in the house of bondage and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
think lightly of peril which surrounds them there. The
great preservative from this danger is to revive constantly
the thought of the great things which have been
done for us. Be in fear of the world and its beguilements,
says St. Peter, <em>knowing that ye were redeemed,
not with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your
vain manner of life handed down from your fathers</em>.
The redemption price is paid, has been paid for all
men. Shall any then be willing to tarry in their
slavery? Ye were redeemed. The work is complete.
"It is finished," was the last sigh of the dying Lord,
who before had testified that His true disciples might be
of good cheer, because He had overcome the world.</p>

<p>But in the hearts of men the world and its allurements
die very hard. The men for whom St. Peter
wrote would surely find this so. They had many of
them lived long either under Judaism or in heathendom,
and would be surrounded still by friends and kinsmen
who clung to the ancient teaching and customs. Prejudices
were sure to abound, and the ties of blood in
such cases are very strong, as we know ourselves from
mission experience in India. The Apostle speaks of
their manner of life as handed down from their fathers.
He may have had in his thought the corruption of the
human race from the sin of our first parents. Generation
after generation has been involved in the consequences
of that primal transgression. But he probably
thought rather of the converts from idolatry and the
life which they had led in their days of ignorance. Of
God's covenant with the chosen people, though now it
was abolished, St. Peter would hardly speak as a <em>vain</em>
manner of life. But to the worship of the heathen the
word might fitly be applied. Paul and Barnabas
entreat the crowd at Lystra, who would have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
sacrifice to them as to their gods, to turn from these
<em>vanities</em> to serve the living God (Acts xiv. 15); and to
the Ephesians St. Paul writes that they should no
longer walk, as the other Gentiles walk, in the <em>vanity</em>
of their mind (Eph. iv. 17). The parents of such
men, having themselves no knowledge, could impart
none to their children, could not lift them higher, could
not make them purer; and yet the ties of natural
affection would plead strongly for what had been held
right by their fathers for generations.</p>

<p>But the price which has been paid for their ransom
may convince them how precious they are in the eyes
of a Father in heaven. They are redeemed <em>with
precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without
spot</em>, even the blood <em>of Christ</em>. For ages the offering of
sacrifices had kept before the minds of Israel the need
of a redemption, but they could do no more. The
blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer
suffice only to the purifying of the flesh, and can never
take away sin. But now the true fountain is opened,
and St. Peter has learnt, and bears witness, what was
the meaning of the words of Jesus, "If I wash thee not,
thou hast no part with Me" (John xiii. 8). The door
of mercy is opened, that by the knowledge of such
wondrous love the hearts of men may be opened also.</p>

<p>And this counsel of God has been from all eternity.
Christ <em>was foreknown before the foundation of the world</em>
as the Lamb to be offered for human redemption. The
world and its history form but a tiny fragment of God's
mighty works, and yet for mankind a plan so overflowing
with love was included in the vision of Jehovah
before man or his home had existence except in the
Divine mind. Now by the Incarnation the secret
counsel is brought to light, and the foretokenings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
type and prophecy receive their interpretation. <em>He
was manifested at the end of the times for your sake.</em>
He was made flesh, and tabernacled among men; He
showed by the signs which He wrought that He was
the Saviour drawing near to them that they might
draw near unto Him. His lifting up on the cross
spake of the true healing of the souls of all who would
look unto Him. And when death had done its work
upon the human body, He was manifested more
thoroughly as the beloved Son of God by His resurrection
from the grave. The first Christians felt that
God's work was now complete, salvation secured. It
is not unnatural therefore that they should expect the
drama of the world's history soon to be closed. For
the Master had not seldom spoken of the coming of a
speedy judgement. Hence the age in which they lived
seemed to merit the name of "the end of the times."
We now can see that the judgement of which Christ
spake was wrought in great part by the overthrow of
Jerusalem, though His words are still prospective, and
will not find their entire fulfilment till the close of
human history; and the whole Christian era may be
intended and included in "the end of the times." This
was the goal towards which God's counsel had been
moving since the world was made. No new revelation
is to be looked for, and we who live in the light of
Christ's religion are those upon whom the ends of the
world are come. In this sense the words may be
applied in every age and to every generation of Christians.
To them, as to St. Peter's converts, the
preacher may testify, "For your sakes" all this was
planned and wrought, and may offer the ransom of the
Saviour to His people, assured that in this speck of
time Christ is being manifested for their sake also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
For <em>they through Him are believers in God</em>, as the Lord
Himself hath testified. "No man cometh unto the
Father but by Me"; "I am the Way, the Truth, and
the Life." The words are as true to-day as when
Christ was upon earth. Since the Fall the glory and
majesty of Jehovah have been unapproachable. Sin
rendered man both unfit and unable to have the pure
communion of the days of innocence. It was the vision
of Jesus by faith which brought Abraham near to God
and filled him with joy. And so with all the saints
and prophets of the first covenant. They beheld Him,
but it was afar off. They greeted the maturing
promises, but only as strangers and pilgrims upon
earth. To the Asian converts and to us also the testimony
of St. Peter and his fellows is from those who
beheld the glory of God as it was manifested in Christ,
who saw Him when raised from the dead, and watched
His ascent into the glory of heaven. And by such
witness faith in what God has wrought is confirmed.
We are sure that He raised Christ from the dead; we
are sure that He has received Him into glory: and
thus through all generations the faith and hope of
Christians are sustained and rest unshaken upon God.</p>

<h3><em>CHRISTIAN BROTHERHOOD: ITS CHARACTER AND
DUTIES</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth
unto unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another from the heart
fervently: having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of
incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth.
For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory thereof as the flower of
grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth: but the word of
the Lord abideth for ever. And this is the word of good tidings which
was preached unto you. Putting away therefore all wickedness, and
all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, as new-born
babes long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye
may grow thereby unto salvation; if ye have tasted that the Lord is
gracious."&mdash;<span class="smcap">1 Peter</span> i. 22-ii. 3.</p></blockquote>


<p>That holy lives have been lived in solitude none
would venture to dispute, and that devout Christians
have found strength for themselves and given
examples to the world by withdrawal from the society
of their fellows is attested more than once in the history
of Christendom. But with lives of such isolation and
seclusion the New Testament exhibits little sympathy.
To whatever preparation the Christian is exhorted, it is
never with a view to himself. Though not of the
world, he is to be in the world, that men may profit by
his example. The prayer of the Lord for His disciples
ere He left them was, not that they might be taken out
of the world, but protected from its evils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Christ's intention was to found a Church, a communion,
a brotherhood, and all His language looks that
way: "One is your Master, and all ye are brethren";
"So let your light shine before men that they may see
your good works and glorify your Father which is in
heaven." And of like character is the teaching of the
Epistles: "Be kindly affectioned in love of the brethren"
(Rom. xii. 10); "Let brotherly love continue"
(Heb. xiii. 1). We are in no way surprised therefore
when St. Peter turns from his exhortations to personal
sobriety, obedience, and holiness, and addresses the
converts on the application of these virtues, that through
them they may bind in closer bonds the brotherhood
of Christ: <em>Seeing ye have purified your souls in your
obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren,
love one another from the heart fervently</em>. Obedience is
the sole evidence by which the believer can show that
God's call has wrought in him effectually. His election
is of the Father's foreknowledge, his sanctification is
the gift of the Holy Spirit, and it is the sprinkling of
the blood of Christ which makes him fit for entry into
the house of the Father. In the Christian, so called
and so aided, there must be a surrender of himself to
the guidance of that Spirit which deigns to guide him.
The law in his members must be mortified, and another
and purer law accepted as the rule of his life. This
law St. Peter calls "the truth" because it has been
made manifest in its perfection in the life of Jesus, who
is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Of this example
St. Paul testifies as "the truth which is in Jesus." He
therefore who would cherish the Christian hope will
purify himself even as Christ is pure. The way and
means unto such purification is obedience.</p>

<p>This first and most needful step the Apostle believes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
from his knowledge of their lives, that these Asian
converts have taken in earnest, and thus have attained
to a love of their brethren which differs utterly from
the love which the world exhibits, which is true,
sincere, unfeigned. But the believer's life is a life of
constant progress. Daily advance is the evidence of
vitality. All the language which Scripture applies to it
proclaims this to be its character. It is called a walk,
a race, a pilgrimage, a warfare. The Christian all his
life through will find himself so far from what Christ
intends to make him that he must ever be pressing
forward. Hence, though they have attained to a stage
of purification, have put off in some degree the old
man, the Apostle's exhortation is, "Press forward";
"Love one another from the heart fervently." The
English word describes a warmth and earnestness of
love which is deep-seated and true, but the original
expresses more than this, more of the sustained effort
to which St. Peter is urging them. It points to
incessant striving, to a constancy like that of the prayers
of the Church for the Apostle himself when he was in
prison, a prayer made unto God without ceasing. So
steadfast must be the Christian love; and such love the
purified, undistracted heart alone can manifest, a heart
which has been released from the entanglements of
earthly ambitions and strivings, whose affections are
fully set on the things above.</p>

<p>Such souls must be filled with the Spirit; a steadfastness
like this comes only of the new birth. And
of this the converts are reminded in the words which
follow: <em>having been begotten again, not of corruptible
seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God</em>. It
is true they are but at the outset of their Christian
course; but if any man be in Christ, he is made a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
creature. And in this connexion the word of God
might be taken in a twofold sense. First, the Word
who was made flesh, in whom was light; and the light
was the life of men. Through His resurrection God
has begotten men again to a life which shall know no
corruption. But the figure which the Apostle presently
employs of the withering grass and the falling flower
carries our mind rather to Christ's explanation of His
own parable. The seed is the word of God, <em>which
liveth and abideth</em>. And throughout the New Testament
the life-possessing and life-giving power of the Gospel
is made everywhere conspicuous. When it was first
proclaimed, we read again and again, "The word of
God grew mightily and prevailed" (Acts xii. 24,
xix. 20); and the figurative language used to describe
its character shows how potent is its might. It is
the sword of the Spirit (Eph. vi. 16); "It is quick
and powerful" (Heb. iv. 12). By it Christ foiled
the tempter. It makes those strong in whom it
abides (1 John ii. 14). It is free, and not bound
(2 Tim. ii. 9). St. Paul calls it "the power of God
unto salvation" (Rom. i. 16), "the word of truth, the
gospel of salvation" (Eph. i. 13), and says, "It comes,
not in word only, but in power" (1 Thess. i. 5). This
is the incorruptible seed of which St. Peter speaks.
And his words force on our thoughts that for such a
seed a fitting ground must be prepared, if the new life
of which it is the source is to bear its due fruit. This
preparation it is which the Apostle is anxious to enforce,
the purifying and cleansing of the seed-plot of men's
hearts. They must not be hardened so as to forbid it
access, and leave it for every chance enemy to trample
on or carry away; they must not be choked with
alien thoughts and purposes: the cares of life, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
pleasures of the world. Such things perish in the
using, and can have no affinity with the living and
abiding word of God, which, even as He, is eternal and
unchanging.</p>

<p>And herewith is bound up a very solemn thought.
The word may be neglected, may be choked, in
individual hearts; but still it liveth and abideth, and will
appear to testify against the scorners: "He that
rejecteth Me and receiveth not My words hath one
that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the
same shall judge him in the last day. For I have not
spoken of Myself" (John xii. 48). But for those who
accept the message of the word and live thereby St.
Peter's language is full of comfort, especially to those
who are in like affliction with these Asian Christians.
For them the acceptance of the faith of Jesus must have
meant the rending asunder of earthly ties; the natural
brotherhood would be theirs no longer. But they are
enrolled in a new family, a family which cannot perish,
whose seed is incorruptible, whose kinship shall stretch
forward and be ever enlarging through all time and
into eternity. For they, like the word by which they
are begotten again, will live and abide for evermore.</p>

<p>And confirming this lesson by the prophecy of Isaiah
(xl. 6-8), the Apostle thus links together the ancient
Scriptures and the New Testament. But in so doing
he shows by his language how he regards the latter
as more excellent and a mighty advance upon the
former. The margin of the Revised Version helpfully
indicates the difference of the words. In Isaiah the
teaching is styled a <em>saying</em>. It was the word whereby
God, through some intermediary, made known His will
to the children of men. But under the Gospel the
word is that living, spiritual power which is used as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
synonymous with the Lord Himself. The word of
good tidings has now been spoken unto men by a Son,
the very image of the Divine substance, the effulgence
of God's glory, and now possesses a might quick even
to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. This
is verily the living word of God (Heb. iv. 12).</p>

<p>And we of to-day can see what ground there was for
the Apostle's faith and for his teaching, how true the
prophetic word has been found in the events of history.
"All flesh is as grass, and all the glory thereof as the
flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower
falleth: but the word of the Lord abideth for ever."
When we cast our thoughts back to the time when St.
Peter wrote, we see the converts who had accepted the
word of God a mere handful of people amid the throngs
of heathendom, the religion which they professed the
scorn of all about them, to the Jews a stumbling-block,
to the Greeks foolishness, and its preachers in the main
a few poor, untrained, uninfluential men, of no rank
or conspicuous ability. On the other hand, worshipping
crowds proclaimed the greatness of Diana of the
Ephesians; and the power of the Roman empire was
at its height, or seemed so, with the whole of the
civilised world owning its sway. And now that
world's wonder, the temple at Ephesus, is a pile of
ruins, and over the Roman power such changes have
passed that it has utterly faded out of existence; but
the doctrines of the Galilean, who claimed to be the
Incarnate Word of God, are daily extending their
influence, proving their vitality to be Divine.</p>

<p>But though in his language he has seemed to mark
the superiority of the Gospel message, the Apostle is
deeply conscious that the office of the preacher has
much, nay its chief character, in common with that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the prophet. Hence he proceeds to call the Gospel
message, now that it is left to lips of Evangelists and
Apostles to proclaim, a <em>saying</em> like that of Isaiah. In
this way he links the New Testament to the Old, the
prophet to the preacher. Both spake the same word
of God; both were moved by the same spirit; both
proclaimed the same deliverance, the one looking
onward in hope to the coming Redeemer, the other
proclaiming that the redemption had been accomplished.
"This is the telling" (the saying) "of good tidings
which was preached unto you."</p>

<p>Here St. Peter seems to allude to a preaching earlier
than his own, and to none can we attribute the
evangelisation of these parts of Asia with more probability
than to St. Paul and his missionary colleagues.
But there was no note of disagreement between these
early ambassadors of Christ. They could all say of
their work, "Whether it were I or they, so we preached,
and so ye believed."</p>

<p>Having spoken of the seed, the Apostle now turns to
the seed-plot which needs its special preparation. It
must be cleared and broken up, or the seed, though
scattered, will have small chance of roothold.</p>

<p>But here St. Peter recurs to his former metaphor.
He has spoken (i. 13) of the Christian's equipment,
how with girded loins he should prepare himself for
the coming struggle. He now speaks of what he must
lay aside. He has been purified, or made to long after
purification, through his obedience to the truth, so that
he can with earnest desire seek to make known his
love to the brethren; and the word of God is powerful
to overcome such dispositions as are destructive of
brotherly love. Hence it is to no hopeless, unaided
conflict that the Apostle urges his converts when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
writes of their <em>putting away therefore all wickedness,
and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil
speakings</em>. It is a formidable list of evils, but St.
Peter's words treat them as forming no part of the true
man. These are overgrowths, which can be stripped
away, though the operation will many a time be painful
enough; they have enveloped and enclosed the sinner,
and cling close about him, but the sanctification of the
Spirit can help him to be unclothed of them all. They
are the forces which make for discord. The word of
good tidings began with "peace on earth, goodwill
towards men." Hence those who hearken to the
message must put away everything contrary thereto.
First in the Apostle's enumeration stands a general
term, <em>wickedness</em>, those which follow it being various
forms of its development. We learn how utterly alien
this <em>wickedness</em> is to the spirit of Christ when we
notice the employment of the word to describe the sin
of Simon: "Thou hast neither part nor lot in this
matter, for thy heart is not right before God" (Acts
viii. 22). Such a man had no comprehension of the
source of the apostolic powers; the sacred things of
God were unknown to one who could treat such gifts
as merchandise. And it is full of interest in the
present connexion to observe that what our English
version there renders "matter" is really, as the margin
(R.V.) shows, "word." It was the word of God
which was mighty in the first preachers, which was
growing and prevailing as they testified unto Christ,
and in this "word" a heart like Simon's could have no
share. He was no fit member of the fellowship of
Christ.</p>

<p><em>Guile</em> was the sin of Jacob, a sin which brake the
bond of brotherhood between him and Esau, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
wrought so much misery in the whole of Jacob's family
history. Guile was not found in Nathanael. The
searching eye of Jesus saw that the sin of the "supplanter"
was not in him. Hence he is pointed out as
an example of the true Israel, that which the race of
Jacob was intended to become.</p>

<p>That <em>hypocrisy</em> is a foe to brotherhood our Lord
makes evident as he reproaches the Pharisees for this
sin. "I thank Thee that I am not as other men are,
nor even as this publican," are words which could
never rise to the lips of him whose heart was purified
by the Spirit of God; and envy brings hatred in its
train. It was by envy that Saul was incited to seek
the death of David; it was from envy that Joseph's
brethren sold him into Egypt; through envy a
greater than Joseph was sold to be crucified (Matt.
xxvii. 18), and this sin led to war in heaven itself.</p>

<p>From <em>evil-speaking</em> these Asian converts themselves
had to suffer, and would know by experience its
mischievous effects. They were spoken against as
evil-doers, as the Apostle notes twice over (1 Peter
ii. 12, iii. 15). This evil adds cowardice to its other
baneful qualities, for it takes advantage of the absence
of him against whom it is directed, and is that vice
which in 2 Cor. xii. 20 is described as <em>backbiting</em>, a
rendering which the Revised Version leaves undisturbed,
while those who indulge in it are called <em>backbiters</em>
(Rom. i. 30). St. James has much to say in its
dispraise: "Speak not one against another, brethren.
He that speaketh against a brother or judgeth his
brother speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law"
(James iv. 11). Such a one is intruding into the prerogative
of God Himself, and passing sentence where he
can have no sure knowledge of the acts which he judges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
"Evil-speaking," says one of the Apostolic Fathers,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> "is
a restless demon, never at peace. So speak no evil of
any, nor take pleasure in listening thereto." By good
works St. Peter instructs his converts to live down
such cowardly slanders, that those who revile their
good manner of life in Christ may be put to shame
thereby. Purity will overcome iniquity, innocence gain
the day against deceit.</p>

<p>But the transformation to which the Apostle exhorts
them must be verily to become a new creation, and so
he goes on to speak of their condition as one akin to
that of new-born babes. These by natural instincts
turn away from all that will hurt them, and seek only
what can nourish and support. To such right inclinations,
to such simplicity of desire, must the Christian
be brought. He has been born again of the word of
God. From this he is to seek his constant nurture, as
instinctively as the babe turns to its mother's breast.
This is able to save the soul (James i. 21), but it
cannot be received unless the vices which war against
it be put away, and a spirit of meekness take their
place. They seek other and less pure food for their
support.</p>

<p>Christians are to <em>long for the spiritual milk which is
without guile</em>. This food for babes in Christ is the
word, which is taken by the Spirit and offered a
nurture for the soul. But there must be a longing
for, a readiness to accept, what is offered. For the
spiritual appeals to the reason of man, and though
offered, is not forced on him. The Spirit takes of the
things of Christ and shows them unto us. And the
purification, the clearing off and putting away corrupt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
dispositions, about which the Apostle speaks so
earnestly, applies an eye-salve to the inward vision
which helps us to see things in their true light, and so
to long for what is really profitable food without guile,
which does not disappoint the hope of those that seek
it. <em>That ye may grow thereby unto salvation.</em> It is
called the word of salvation. "To you," says St. Paul
to the men of Antioch (Acts xiii. 26), is the word of
this salvation sent forth; and through it is proclaimed
the remission of sins. The healthy condition of the
life of the soul is evidenced by these two signs: longing
for proper food and growth by partaking thereof. For
there is no standing still in spiritual life, any more than
in the natural life. Where there is no growth, decay
has already set in; if there be no waxing of the powers,
they have already begun to wane. To the natural
human growth there must needs come this waning;
the body will decay: but the spiritual increase can
continue, must continue, until the stature of the
fulness of Christ be attained, till we come to be made
like unto Him when we see Him as He is. Watch,
then, strive and pray for growth, <em>if ye have tasted that
the Lord is gracious</em>. The true food once found and
appreciated, the joy of this support will be such that
no other will ever be desired. Hence St. Peter adopts,
or rather adapts, the words of the Psalmist (xxxiv. 9)
who tells of the blessedness of trusting in the Lord.
The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them
that fear Him, and setteth them free. This is the
initial stage: the deliverance from the power of evil.
Then come the desire and longing for the true
strength. "O taste and see that the Lord is gracious;
blessed is the man that findeth refuge in Him." The
joy of such a refuge can come even to those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
suffering after the fashion of the Asian converts. But
the Psalmist's words are full of teaching. God's training
is empirical. Spiritual experience comes before
spiritual knowledge. Well does St. Bernard say of
this lesson, though his words pass the power of translation,
"Unless you have tasted you will not see. The
food is the hidden manna; it is the new name which no
one knows but he who receives it. It is not external
training, but the unction of the Spirit, which teaches;
it is not knowledge (<em>scientia</em>) which grasps the truth,
but the conscience (<em>conscientia</em>) which attests it."</p>

<h3><em>THE PRIESTHOOD OF BELIEVERS</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but
with God elect, precious, ye also, as living stones, are built up a
spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. Because it is contained in
Scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, elect, precious:
and he that believeth on Him shall not be put to shame. For you
therefore which believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve,
the stone which the builders rejected, the same was made
the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling and a rock of
offence; for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto
also they were appointed. But ye are an elect race, a royal priesthood,
a holy nation, a people for <em>God's</em> own possession, that ye may
show forth the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness
into His marvellous light: which in time past were no people, but
now are the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now
have obtained mercy."&mdash;<span class="smcap">1 Peter</span> ii. 4-10.</p></blockquote>


<p>Leaving the exhortation to individual duties, the
Apostle turns now to describe the Christian
society in relation to its Divine Founder, and tells
both of the privileges possessed by believers, and of
the services which they ought to render. He employs
for illustration a figure very common in Holy Scripture,
and compares the faithful to stones in the structure
of some noble edifice, built upon a sure foundation.
Such language on his lips must have had a deep
significance. He was the rock-man; his name Peter
was bestowed by Christ in recognition of his grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
confession: and Jesus had consecrated the simile which
the Apostle uses by His own words, "Upon this rock
I will build My Church" (Matt. xvi. 18), words which
were daily finding a blessed fulfilment in the growth
of these Asian Churches.</p>

<p>A rock is no unusual figure in the Old Testament
to represent God's faithfulness, and its use is specially
frequent in Isaiah and the Psalms. "In the Lord
Jehovah is an everlasting rock" (Isa. xxvi. 4), says the
prophet; again he calls God "the rock of Israel"
(xxx. 29); while the prayers of the Psalmist are full
of the same thought concerning the Divine might and
protection: "Be Thou my strong rock and my fortress"
(Psalm xxxi. 2); "Lead me to the rock that is higher
than I" (lxi. 2); "O God, my rock and my Redeemer"
(xix. 14).</p>

<p>But the language of the New Testament goes farther
than that of the Old. Strength, protection, permanence&mdash;these
were attributes of the rock of which Isaiah spake
and David sang. The life-possessing and life-imparting
virtue of the Spirit of Christ is a part of the glad
tidings of the Gospel. Through Him were light and
immortality brought to light. The rock which lives
is found in Jesus Christ. In Him is life without
measure, ready to be imparted to all who seek to be
built up in Him.</p>

<p><em>Unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of
men, but with God elect, precious.</em> By purification of
thought, and act, and word, that childlike frame has
been sought after which fits them to draw near; and
they come with full assurance. Jesus they know as
the Crucified, as the Lord who came to His own, and
they received Him not. Generations of preparation
had not made Jewry ready for her King's coming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
had failed to impress the people with the signs of His
advent; and so they disowned Him, and cried, "We
have no king but Cæsar." But the converts know
Jesus also as Him who was raised from the dead and
exalted to glory. This honour He hath "with God."
No other than He could bring salvation. Therefore
has He received a name that is above every name.
And "with God" here signifies that heavenly exaltation
and glory. The sense is<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> as when Jesus testifies,
"I speak what I have seen <em>with My Father</em>" (John viii.
38)&mdash;that is, in heaven&mdash;or when He prays, "Glorify
me, O Father, <em>with Thine own self</em>" (xvii. 5). From
this excellent glory He sends down His Spirit, and
gives to His people a share of that life which has
been made manifest in Him. Their part is but to come,
to seek; and every one that seeketh is sure to find.</p>

<p><em>Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house.</em>
Not because they are living men does the Apostle speak
of them as living stones. They may be full of the
vigour of natural life, yet have no part in Christ. The
life which joins men to Him comes by the new birth.
And the union of believers with Christ makes itself
patent by a daily progress. He is a living stone; they
are to be made more and more like Him by a constant
drawing near, a constant drinking in from His fulness
of the life which is the light of men. In this light new
graces grow within them; old sins are cast aside. By
this preparation, this shaping of the living stones, the
Spirit fits Christians for their place in the spiritual
building, unites them with one another and with Christ,
fashions out of them a true communion of saints&mdash;saints,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
who, that they may advance in saintliness, have
duties to perform both directly to God and for His
sake to the world around. By diligence therein the
upbuilding goes daily forward.</p>

<p>First, they are <em>to be a holy priesthood, to offer up
spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ</em>.
From the day when God revealed His will on Sinai,
such has been the ideal set before His chosen servants.
"Ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests and a
holy nation" (Exod. xix. 6) stands in the preface
of the Divinely given law. And God changes not.
Hence the praise of the Lamb's finished work when
He has purchased unto God men of every tribe, and
tongue, and people, and nation is sung before the throne
in the self-same strain: "Thou madest them to be
unto God a kingdom and priests" (Rev. v. 10). Under
the early dispensation God was leading men up from
material sacrifices to pay unto Him true spiritual
worship. The Psalmist has learnt the lesson when
he pleads, "Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and
put your trust in the Lord" (Psalm iv. 6); and
Hosea's sense of what was well-pleasing to God is
made clear in his exhortation, "Take with you
words and return unto the Lord; say unto Him, Take
away all iniquity, and accept that which is good, so
will we render as bullocks the offering of our lips"
(xiv. 3). The Apostle to the Romans is hardly more
explicit than this when he urges, "Present your bodies
a living sacrifice" (xii. 1), or to the Hebrews, "Let
us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually,
that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to His
name" (xiii. 15).</p>

<p>But the Apostles could add to the exhortations of
the prophets and psalmists a ground of blessed assurance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
could promise how these living sacrifices, these
offerings of praise, had gained a certainty of acceptance
through Jesus Christ: "Through Him we have boldness
and access in confidence through our faith in
Him" (Eph. iii. 12); and in another place, "Having
Him as a great Priest over the house of God,"
that spiritual house into which believers are builded,
"let us draw near with a true heart, in fulness of
faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience
and our bodies washed with pure water"
(Heb. x. 22). Thus do believers become priests unto
God, in every place lifting up holy hands in prayer,
prayer which is made acceptable through their great
High-priest.</p>

<p>It was only from oral teaching that these Asian
Christians knew of those lessons which we now can
quote as the earliest messages to the Church of Christ.
The Scripture was to them as yet the Scripture of
the Old Testament, and to this St. Peter points them
for the confirmation which it supplies. And his quotation
is worthy of notice both for its manner and its
matter: <em>Because it is contained in Scripture, Behold,
I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, elect, precious: and he
that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.</em> The
passage is from Isaiah (xxviii. 16); but a comparison
with that verse shows us that the Apostle has not
quoted all the words of the prophet, and that what he
has given corresponds much more closely with the
Greek of the Septuagint than with the Hebrew. The
latter concludes, "He that believeth shall not make
haste," and contains some words not represented in
the version of the Seventy. The variations which
St. Peter accepts are such as to assure us that for him
(and the same is true for the rest of the Apostles) the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
purport, the spiritual lessons, of the word were all
which he counted essential. Neither Christ Himself
nor His Apostles adhere in quotation to precise verbal
exactness.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> They felt that there lay behind the older
record so many deep meanings for which the fathers
of old were not prepared, but which Gospel light made
clear. To somewhat of this fuller sense the translators
of the Septuagint seem to have been guided.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> They
lived nearer to the rising of the day-star. Through
their labours God was in part preparing the world for
the message of Christ. The words which Isaiah was
guided to use express the confidence of a believer who
was looking onward to God's promise as in the future:
"He shall not make haste." He knows that the
purpose of God will be brought to pass; that, as the
prophet elsewhere says, "the Lord will hasten it in
its time" (lx. 22). Man is not to step in, Jacob-like,
to anticipate the Divine working.</p>

<p>But "shall not be ashamed" was a form of the
promise more suited to the days of St. Peter and these
infant Churches. For the name of Christ was in many
ways made a reproach; and only men of faith, like
Moses and the heroes celebrated with him in Heb. xi.,
could count that reproach greater riches than the treasures
of Egypt. Other and weaker hearts needed
encouragement, needed to be pointed to the privileges
and glories which are the inheritance of the followers
of Jesus. And in this spirit he applies the prophetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
words, <em>For you therefore which believe is the preciousness</em>.
Faith makes real all the offers of the Gospel. It opens
heaven, as to the vision of St. Stephen, so that while
they are still here believers behold the glory of God
to which Christ has been exalted, are assured of the
victory which has been won for them, and that in His
strength they may conquer also. Thus they receive
continually the earnest of those precious and exceeding
great promises (2 Peter i. 4) whereby they become
partakers of the Divine nature.</p>

<p>But all men have not faith. The Bible tells us this
on every page. God knows what is in man, and in
His revelation He has set forth not only invitations and
blessings, but warnings and penalties. Life and good,
death and evil&mdash;these have been continually proclaimed
as linked together by God's law, but ever with the
exhortation, "Choose life." Of such warning messages
St. Peter gives examples from prophecy and psalm:
<em>But for such as disbelieve, the stone which the builders
rejected, the same was made the head of the corner</em> (Psalm
cxviii. 22), <em>and a stone of stumbling and a rock of
offence</em> (Isa. viii. 14); <em>for they stumble at the word, being
disobedient</em>. Here the Apostle touches the root of the
evil. The test of faith is obedience. It was so in
Eden; it must be ever so. But now, as then, the
tempter comes with his insidious questionings, "Hath
God said?" and sowing doubts, he goes his way,
leaving them to work; and work they do. Now it is
the truth, now the wisdom, of the command, that men
stumble at. But in each case they disobey. Those
leave it unobserved; these despise and set it at nought.
And the penalty is sure. For mark the twofold aspect
of God's dealing which is set forth in the passages
chosen by St. Peter to enforce his lesson. Spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
man's disobedience, God's purpose is not thwarted.
The stone which He laid in Zion has been made the
head of the corner. Though rejected by some builders,
it has lost none of its preciousness, none of its strength.
Those who draw near unto it find life thereby; are
made fit for their places in the Divine building, in the
kingdom of the Lord's house which He will most surely
establish as the latter days draw on. But they who
disobey are overthrown. The despised stone, which is
the sure word of God, rises up in men's self-chosen
path, and makes them fall, and at the last, if they
persist in despising it, will appear for their condemnation.</p>

<p><em>Whereunto also they were appointed.</em> The Apostle has
in mind the words of Isaiah, how the prophet, in that
place from which he has just quoted, declares that many
shall stumble and fall, and be broken, and be snared,
and be taken. This is the lot of the disobedient.
These penalties dog that sin. It is the unvarying law
of God. The Bible teaches this from first to last, by
precepts as well as by examples. The disobedient must
stumble. But the Bible does not teach that any were
appointed unto disobedience. Such fatalist lessons are
alien to God's infinite love. The two ways are set
before all men. God tries us thus because He has
gifted us above the rest of creation, that we may render
Him a willing service. But neither prophet nor Apostle
teaches that to stumble is to be finally cast away.
Both picture God's mercy in as large terms as those in
which St. Paul speaks of the Jews: "Did God cast off
His people? God forbid.... They, if they continue
not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in, for God is able
to graft them in again" (Rom. xi.).</p>

<p>A hardening in part hath befallen Israel, and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Church of Christ there is offered the blessedness which
aforetime was to be the portion of the chosen people.
But the offer is made on like terms of obedient service,
and involves large duties. St. Peter marks the likeness
of the two offers by choosing the words of the Old
Testament to describe the Christian calling, with its
privileges and its duties. Believers in Christ are a
peculiar treasure unto God from among all people, a
kingdom of priests, and a holy nation, even as was said
to Israel (Exod. xix. 5, 6) when they came out of Egypt
and received the Law from Sinai. But among the dispersion,
for whom he writes, there were those who had
been heathens, as well as the converts from Judaism.
That he may show them also to be embraced in the
new covenant, and their calling contemplated under the
old, the Apostle points to another of God's promises,
where Hosea (i. 10; ii. 23) tells of the grace that was
ready to be shed forth on them which in time past
were no people, but now are the people of God, which
had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
Thus all, Jew and Gentile, are to be made one holy
fellowship, one people for God's own possession.</p>

<p>And this kingdom of God's priests has its duty to
the world as well as unto God. Israel in time past
was chosen to be God's witness to the rest of mankind,
so that when men saw that no nation had God so nigh
unto them as Jehovah was whenever Israel called
upon Him, that no nation had statutes and judgements
so righteous as all the Law which had been given from
Sinai, they might be constrained to say, "Surely this
great nation is a wise and understanding people," and
might themselves be won to the service of a God so
present and so holy. And now each member of the
Christian body, while offering himself a living sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to God, while delighting to do His will, while treasuring
His law, is to exercise himself in wider duties, that
God's glory may be displayed unto all men. One of
the psalmists, whose words have been in part referred
to Christ Himself, testifies how this priesthood for mankind
should be fulfilled: "I have published righteousness
in the great congregation; lo, I will not refrain
my lips, O Lord, Thou knowest. I have not hid Thy
righteousness within my heart; I have declared Thy
faithfulness and Thy salvation; I have not concealed
Thy loving-kindness and Thy truth from the great congregation"
(Psalm xl. 9, 10). These were the excellencies
which the Psalmist had found in God's service,
and his heart ran over with desire to impart the knowledge
unto others. With juster reason shall Christ's
servants be prompted to a like evangel. They cannot
hold their peace, specially while they consider how
great blessings those lose who as yet own no allegiance
to their Master.</p>

<p><em>That ye may show forth the excellencies of Him who
called you out of darkness into His marvellous light.</em>
This theme fills the rest of the letter. The Apostle
teaches that in every condition this duty has its place
and its opportunities. Subjects may fulfil it, as they
yield obedience to their rulers, servants in the midst
of service to their masters, wives and husbands in
their family life, each individual in the society where
his lot is cast, and specially those who preside over the
Christian congregations. Wherever the goodness of
God's mercy has been tasted, there should be hearts
full of thanksgiving, voices tuned to the praise of Him
who has done great things for them. Lives led with
this aim will make men to be truly what God designs:
a holy nation; a kingdom of priests. And ever as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
men walk thus will the kingdom for which we daily
pray be brought nearer.</p>

<p>The opportunities for winning men to Christ differ
in modern times from those which were open to the
earliest Christian converts; but there is still no lack
of adversaries, no lack of those by whom the hope of
the believer is deemed unreasonable: and now, as
then, the good works which the opponents behold in
Christian lives will have their efficacy. These cannot
for ever be spoken against. A good manner of life in
Christ shall, through His grace, finally put the gainsayers
to shame. They shall learn, and gain blessing
with the lesson, that the stone which they have so
long been rejecting has been set up by God to be the
foundation of His Church, the head stone of the corner,
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</p>

<h3><em>CHRISTIANS AS PILGRIMS IN THE WORLD</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Beloved, I beseech you, as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain
from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; having your behaviour
seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as
evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify
God in the day of visitation. Be subject to every ordinance of man
for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto
governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise
to them that do well. For so is the will of God, that by well-doing
ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: as free, and
not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants
of God. Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God.
Honour the king."&mdash;<span class="smcap">1 Peter</span> ii. 11-17.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Apostle opens his exhortations with a word
eminently Christian: <em>Beloved</em>. It is a word
whose history makes us alive to and thankful for the
Septuagint Version. Without that translation there
would have been no channel through which the religious
ideas of Judaism could have been conveyed to the
minds of the Western peoples. There are several
Greek words which signify "to love," but bound up
with every one of them is some sense which renders
it ill-fitted to describe true Christian love and still less
suited for expressing the love of God to man. The
word in the text has been fashioned to tell of that love
which St. Paul describes in his "more excellent way"
(1 Cor. xiii.). In classic speech it implies more of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
outward exhibition of welcome, than of deep affection.
But the translators of the Septuagint have taken it
specially for themselves, and use it first to express the
love of Abraham for Isaac (Gen. xxii. 2); and, thus
consecrating and elevating it, they have brought it
at length to great dignity, for they employ it to signify
the love of the Lord for His people and the highest
love of man to God: "The Lord preserveth all them
that love Him" (Psalm cxlv. 20); "The Lord loveth
the righteous" (cxlvi. 8). So in the New Testament
it can be used of the "well-beloved" Son Himself.
With such an expression of their union to each other
in the Lord does St. Peter preface his admonitions.
They are counsels of love.</p>

<p><em>I beseech you, as sojourners and pilgrims.</em> The Christian
looks for a life eternal. In comparison thereof the
best things of this time are of little account, while the
evil of the world renders it no safe resting-place. It
is but as a lodging for a brief night, and at dawn the
traveller sets forward for his true home. Hence the
argument of the apostolic entreaty. You have no long
time to stay, and none to waste; your motto is ever,
"Onward!" <em>I beseech you to abstain from fleshly lusts,
which war against the soul.</em> Of the perils of life's
journey the Psalmist gives us a telling sketch in the
first verse of Psalm i.; and if we may accept the
words as the outcome of David's experience, they
teach us the subtlety of these lusts of the flesh, as they
war against the soul. They had led David to adultery
and murder. The first stage of the course through
which they carry you is described as walking by the
counsel of the ungodly. It is not being of their
number, but only being ready to accept their advice;
and though the course has begun, it is still possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
for him who walks to turn round and to turn back.
The next step shows captivation. The man stands in
the way of sinners, not afraid of his company now,
though they have a taint of positive guilt instead of the
negative character of ungodliness. But the war against
the soul goes on; and the captive at the next stage
sinks down willingly, is pleased with his chains, sits
in the seat of the scorners, as ready now as they
to make a mock at sin. With good reason does St.
Peter use most solemn words of entreaty. The peril
at all times is great. The flesh warreth against the
spirit. We cannot do the things that we would. But
for these men the danger was extreme. Some of them
had lived in surroundings where such sins were counted
a part of religious duty; had the support of long
prescription; were sanctioned and indulged in by
those of the convert's own blood.</p>

<p>Yet the Apostle does not counsel the new-made
Christians to run away from this battle. They owe
a duty to those who are out of the way, and must not
shrink from it, be it ever so painful: <em>having your
behaviour seemly among the Gentiles</em>. Their lives are
to be led in the sight of their fellow-men, to be so
led as to have the approval of a clear conscience, and
to be void of offence in the eyes of others. This
outward seemliness is what Christian love exhibits as
a testimony to Christ's grace and an attraction unto
the world, making known unto all men the unsearchable
riches of Christ: <em>that, wherein they speak against you
as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they
behold, glorify God in the day of visitation</em>. The seemly
conduct of believers must be continuous, or it will
fail of its effect. It is not one display of Christian
conduct, nor occasional spasmodic manifestations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
thereof, which will win men to love the way of Christ.
And this is the result without which Christ's people
are not to rest satisfied. The evil reports of the
adversaries are ill-grounded, but they do not think so;
and the only means of removing their perverse view
is by a continuous revelation of the excellence of Christ's
service. They may rail, but we must bless; they may
persecute: we must not retaliate, but returning good
always for their evil, make them see at length that
this way which they are attacking has a character and
a power to which they have been strangers. This
enlightenment is implied in the word "behold":
<em>They behold your good works</em>. It denotes initiation into
a mystery. And to unbelievers Christ's religion must
be a mystery. The clearing of the vision leads them
up to faith. The word in every place where it occurs
in the New Testament is St. Peter's own, and he
employs it once (2 Peter i. 16) to describe the vision,
the insight, into the glory of Christ, which he and his
fellows gained at the Transfiguration. Such a sight
removes all questionings, and constrains the enlightened
soul to join in the exclamation, "Lord, it is good for us
to be here." The victory for Christ is to be won on
the very ground where the opposition was made. In
the very matter over which the enemy reviled, there
shall they praise God for that which they erewhile
maligned. This it is which constitutes their day of
visitation. Some have thought the visitation intended
was to be one of punishment for obstinate withstanding
of the truth, but it surely harmonises better with the
glory of God that the dispensation should be one of
instruction and light. We seem to have a notable
example of what is meant in the history of St. Paul.
He in all earnestness persecuted the Way unto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
death. The day of visitation came to him, a day which,
while darkening the bodily vision, gave a clearness to
the soul. The persecutor became the Apostle to the
Gentiles, and the world bore him witness that now he
preached the faith of which he had once made havoc
(Gal. i. 23). This was God's own conquest, but in the
same manner will believers be helped to win their
victory. They are to aim at nothing less, never to rest
content till the accusers of their good deeds are brought
to glory in the performance of the same. So was
Justin Martyr won to the side of Christianity: "When
I heard the Christians accused and saw them fearless
of death and of everything else that is counted fearful,
I was sure they could not be living in wickedness and
in the love of pleasures" (2 Apol. xii.). Well-doing
shall not fail of its reward. Men will testify, as of
Isaac of old "We saw plainly that the Lord was with
thee, and we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt
us" (Gen. xxvi. 28).</p>

<p>The Apostle now turns to one illustration of Christian
behaviour wherein the converts might be tempted to
think themselves absolved from some portion of their
duty. They were living under heathen rulers. Did
their freedom in Christ release them from obligations to
the civil powers? The question was sure to arise.
St. Peter supplies both a rule and a reason: <em>Be subject
to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake</em>. Christians,
just as other men, hold their place in the
commonweal. All that the state requires citizens to do
in aid of good government, order, the support of
institutions and the like, will fall upon them, as upon
others. Whether the demands made upon them in this
wise be always for ends of which they would approve,
they are not to discuss so long as their rulers provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
duly for the social order and welfare. This is the
apostolic rule. The reason is, Men are to submit
thus for the Lord's sake. The powers that be are
ordained of God, and He would have obedience yielded
to them. The Bible knows nothing about forms of
government; these are to be ordered as men at various
times and under various conditions deem most helpful.
But the Bible doctrine is that God uses all powers of
the world for His own purposes and to work out His
will. Of Pharaoh, who had deliberately despised God's
messages through Moses, the Divine voice declared that
he would long ago have been cut off from the earth,
but was made to stand that he might show God's
power, and that His name might be declared throughout
all the earth (Exod. ix. 15, 16); and of the
Assyrian at a later day (Isa. x. 10, 12) God tells how
he was used as the rod of the Divine anger, but that
the fruit of his stout heart and the glory of his high
looks would surely be punished. God employs for His
ends instruments with which He is not always well-pleased.
These can inflict His penalties, yea even may
be made to advance His glory. Pilate was assured
by Christ Himself that the power which he was about
to exercise was only by Divine permission: "Thou
wouldest have no power against Me except it were
given thee from above" (John xix. 11); and St. Paul
enforces obedience to authorities equally with St. Peter:
"He that resisteth the power withstandeth the ordinance
of God" (Rom. xiii. 2). Be subject, therefore,
<em>whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto governors,
as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for
praise to them that do well</em>. The order under which
these converts were living was superintended by some
officer appointed by the Roman emperor, and to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the form of the Apostle's words applies. The king is
the Cæsar; the governor is the procurator or subordinate
official by whom the imperial power was represented in
the provinces. When St. Peter wrote, Nero ruled in
Rome, and was represented abroad by ministers often
of a like character.</p>

<p>How extreme must after this be the case of those
who would claim freedom to resist the rulers under
whom they live. God has allowed them to stand, He
is using them for His own purposes, they may be the
ministers of His vengeance, and to Him alone does
vengeance belong. He intends them also to recognise
the merit of the doers of good. It may be that they do
not fulfil God's intent in either wise, yet while He
suffers them to keep their power the Christian's duty
is obedience to every civil enactment, for anarchy
would be a curse both to him and to others, bringing
in its train more hurt than help. When Christians
shall be found among those who abide by the law of the
lands wherein they dwell, even should their faith not
be accepted by their rulers, their good citizenship will
hardly fail to disarm hatred and abate persecution.
And so they are to range themselves ever on the side
of order. <em>For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye
should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.</em> For
this end believers are to abide in the world, that
through them the world may be renewed. The opponents
of their faith suffer, says the Apostle, from lack
of knowledge. As he says in another place, "they rail
in matters whereof they are ignorant" (2 Peter ii. 12).
Had men known, they would not have crucified the
Lord of glory; and did they know, they would not
persecute His followers. But knowledge will not come
without a preacher. Such preachers of the excellence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of their faith shall the law-abiding Christians in each
community be made. They shall publish the lessons
of their own experience; they shall win favour by their
example. The world will recognise that these men
have a secret which others do not possess, will find
that they yield obedience to earthly rulers because they
are above all things servants of God. It was through
convicting them of their ignorance that Jesus put the
Sadducees to silence. "Ye do err," was His argument,
"not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God"
(Matt. xxii. 34). And when men are made sensible
of such ignorance, they are silenced for very shame
(1 Cor. xv. 34). This word "silenced" is very expressive
both in the Gospel and here. It implies that a
bridle or muzzle is put upon the mouth of ignorance,
so that it may either be guided into a better way, or, if
not so, be checked from doing harm. For some there
are who not only will be ignorant, but foolish also,
whom no teaching will profit. But even these will in
the end be silenced. So, as says the brother Apostle,
"be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with
good" (Rom. xii. 21).</p>

<p>The first part of the Apostle's exhortation in our
verse had in view, it may be, more especially the
Gentile converts. Their past life had been one of evil-doing
in the sight of God; those whom they had left,
and who were most likely to be their adversaries, were
still walking in the same ways, and were to be won
over and conquered for Christ. He now turns more
directly to those who had been Jews. These were no
longer bound to the observance of the ceremonial law,
and we know from the New Testament as well as from
Church history that with this release there were exhibited
in the lives of many such excesses as made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
them a disgrace to the Christian name. We find much
about these in the Second Epistle. St. Peter would not
keep the Jewish converts under the burden of the Law,
but he warns them against their besetting danger: <em>as
free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness,
but as bondservants of God</em>. There were bad
Jews, even as there have been bad Christians. These
would welcome a rule which set them at liberty from
the Mosaic observances, to which their adherence
aforetime had been in outward seeming rather than in
earnest zeal. To these St. Peter preaches that to lay
aside Judaism is not to embrace Christianity. The
Leader of the new faith had ever taught a different
lesson. He came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil
it, and to set forth God's will in a nobler aspect.
Those who would follow Him must take up the cross.
His service is a yoke which restrains from all evil.
Those who come to Christ come as bondservants of
God, free only because they are bound to the observance
of the noblest law. They must lay aside the flesh,
with its affections and lusts, and not vindicate their
freedom by using it as an occasion to riot and self-indulgence.</p>

<p>And the Apostle binds together all his teaching in
four closing precepts: <em>Honour all men; Love the
brotherhood; Fear God; Honour the king</em>. All men,
without distinction, are to be honoured, because in all
there remains the image of God. It may be defaced,
blurred exceedingly. The more needful is it to deal
considerately with such, that we may help to restore
what has been marred. Those who are our brethren
in Christ, the brotherhood, we shall own with affection,
seeking to be of one heart and one soul with them,
because they belong to Christ. For them we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
have, if we be true to our faith, that mighty love which
passeth in excellence both faith and hope. But the
exhortation of St. Peter speaks in this wise: Ye who
hold your brethren in Christ unspeakably dear, do not
allow that love to suffice, to swallow up all regard for
other men. They also need your thoughts, your help.
The heathen, the unbelievers&mdash;these have the strongest
possible claim, even their great need. And so with
the other pair of precepts. Ye who fear God, which is
your foremost duty, do not let that fear lessen your
willingness to do honour to your earthly rulers. The
feelings toward God and the king differ in character
and in degree, but both have their place in proper
share in the heart of the true servant of Christ.</p>

<h3><em>CHRISTIAN SERVICE</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Servants, be in subjection to your masters, with all fear; not only
to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. For this is acceptable,
if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering
wrongfully. For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted
<em>for it</em>, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well and suffer
<em>for it</em>, ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. For
hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you,
leaving you an example, that ye should follow His steps: who did
no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth: who, when He was
reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, threatened not; but
committed <em>Himself</em> to Him that judgeth righteously; who His own
self bare our sins in His body upon the tree, that we, having died
unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were
healed. For ye were going astray like sheep, but are now returned
unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls."&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> ii. 18-25.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Gospel history shows very clearly that during
our Lord's lifetime His followers were drawn largely
from the ranks of the poor. It was fitting that He who
had been proclaimed in prophecy as "the Servant of
the Lord" should enter the world in humble estate;
and, from the lowly position of the virgin-mother and
her husband, the life of Jesus for thirty years must
have been spent in comparative poverty and amid poor
surroundings. The major part of His chosen disciples
were fisherfolk and such-like. And though we read of
the wife of Herod's steward among the women who
ministered unto Him and of the richer Joseph of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Arimathæa as a secret disciple, these are marked
exceptions. To the poor His Gospel was preached, and
among the poor it first made its way. The question of
the chief priests, "Hath any of the rulers believed on
Him, or the Pharisees?" (John vii. 48), tells its own
tale, as does also the significant record, "The common
people heard Him gladly" (Mark xii. 37).</p>

<p>It need not therefore much surprise us if St. Peter,
now that he begins to classify his counsels, addresses
himself first to "household servants": <em>Servants, be in
subjection to your masters, with all fear</em>. We have,
however, to bear in mind, as we consider the Apostle's
exhortation, that most of those whom he addresses
were slaves. They had no power of withdrawing
themselves, though their service should prove burdensome
and grievous. St. Paul, in writing to the same
class, nearly always employs the word which means
"bondservants." Yet his counsel agrees with St.
Peter's. Thus he exhorts that their service be "with
fear and trembling" (Eph. vi. 5); in Col. iii. 22,
"Obey in all things them that are your masters."
And to Timothy and Titus it is given as a part of their
charge to "exhort servants to be in subjection to their
own masters and to be well-pleasing to them in all
things" (1 Tim. vi. 1; Titus ii. 9).</p>

<p>When St. Peter and St. Paul wrote, this slave
population was everywhere very numerous. Gibbon
calculates that in the reign of Claudius the slaves were
at least equal in number to the free inhabitants of the
Roman world; Robertson places the estimate much
higher. These formed, then, a very large share of the
public to which the first preachers had to appeal, and
we can understand the importance to the Christian
cause of the behaviour of these humble, but doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
most numerous, members of the society. Their lives
would be a daily sermon in the houses of their masters.
Hence the very earnest exhortations addressed to them
that by their conduct they should adorn the doctrine of
God our Saviour in all things; that they should count
their masters worthy of all honour; that the name of
God and of the doctrine be not blasphemed; that they
should be in subjection <em>with all fear</em>. Everything in
the New Testament concerning slaves goes to show
that they were a most important factor in the early
Christian societies.</p>

<p>Men wonder nowadays that there is so little said
by any of the Apostles about freeing slaves from their
bondage. The best men in those times and long
before appear to have regarded slavery as one of the
institutions with which they were bound to rest content.
It flourished everywhere; it was countenanced in the
Scriptures of the older dispensation. Eleazar was
Abraham's slave, and the Law in many passages contemplates
the possession by Israelites of persons who
were bought with their money. Hence we find no
remonstrance against slave-holding in the New Testament
writings, only advice to those who were in such
bondage to cultivate a spirit which would render it less
galling and to strive that by their behaviour the cause
of Christ might be advanced. St. Paul represents the
ideas of his age when, writing to the Corinthians, he
says, "Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not
for it; but if thou canst be made free, use <em>it</em> rather"
(1 Cor. vii. 21). Freedom was worth having, but any
heroic effort to get rid of the yoke is not encouraged
in the Epistles. Yet it must have been a lot which
called for the exercise of much moral strength to make
it bearable. Even from the house of the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Philemon the slave Onesimus found cause to run away.
But St. Paul in his letter admits no right on the
slave's part to take this course. With the Apostle
there is no question that the first duty is to go back
to his master. All that he urges is that the common
profession of Christianity by slave and master ought
to, and doubtless would, alleviate the conditions of
servitude. There were in Christianity, as time has
shown, germs which would fructify, a spirit which
some day would strike on the chains of slaves. But
the vision of such a time had not dawned either for
St. Paul or St. Peter. Christ has overcome the world
in many other matters beside slavery. It is only that
Christians are so tardy in awaking to the fulness of His
lessons.</p>

<p>So in apostolic days the rights and claims of slave-masters
were looked upon as indisputable. Be subject,
<em>not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward</em>.
There is to be no resistance, no lapse in duty. About
service rendered to good masters there might be little
apprehension, but even here St. Paul finds occasion
for warning. "They that have believing masters," he
says, "let them not despise them because they are
brethren" (1 Tim. vi. 2). Christian freedom was not
without its dangers in many forms, especially to minds
wherein liberty was a strange idea. But froward
masters are to be faithfully served likewise, and care
is to be taken withal to remove every occasion for their
frowardness. The apostolic lesson is to make suffering
endurable, noble, acceptable to God, by seeing that
it be always undeserved. How strange a doctrine this
in the eyes of the world! The rule of purely human
conduct would be just the opposite. If wrong be
undeserved, rebel at once. Christianity supplies a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
motive for the contrary course: <em>conscience toward God</em>.
The world's spirit is not His spirit, and to have praise
with Him should be the Christian's single aim. Men
can at times be patient when rebuke is deserved, but
the world sees that that deserves no credit. "What
thank have ye?" they cry. But they give no praise
for the bearing of unmerited rebuke.</p>

<p>The world counts such conduct weakness, and is
still far from comprehending the Divineness of the
virtue of yielding patiently to wrong. God has long
been teaching the lesson, but it has been slowly learnt.
He chose the milder, timid Jacob rather than the fiery
Esau. Both had faults in multitude. With the world
Esau is oft the favourite. At a later day He stamps
with approval the noble mercy of David in sparing
Saul, while round Daniel and his companions in Babylon
there gathers something of a halo of New Testament
sanctity by reason of the noble confession which they
made under persecution. These are chapters in the
Divine lesson-book. Such lives marked stages in the
preparation for the Servant of the Lord. Men, if they
would have hearkened, were being trained to estimate
such a character at God's value. Now Christ's example
is before us, and we are bidden to follow it.</p>

<p><em>For hereunto were ye called.</em> Strange invitation to be
dictated by love, a call to suffering! And yet the
Master at first promises nothing else to His followers:
"If any man would come after Me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me" (Matt.
xvi. 24). And what can a Christian wish for but to be
like Christ? And the very reason given ought to
make us love the cross. We are called unto suffering
because Jesus suffered for us, leaving us an example
that we should follow His steps. He has trodden the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
hard road, the winepress of the wrath of God, alone
and for men. At this point the Apostle begins to
apply to Christ Isaiah's description of the suffering
"Servant of the Lord," "who did no sin, neither was
guile found in His mouth" (Isa. liii.). But soon the
memory of the scenes he had witnessed is present with
him; and his words, though holding to the spirit of
Isaiah's picture, become a description of what he himself
had seen and heard when Jesus was taken and
crucified: <em>Who, when He was reviled, reviled not again;
when He suffered, threatened not, but committed Himself
to Him that judgeth righteously</em>. How the brief words
sum up and recall the dark history&mdash;Caiaphas, Pilate,
and Herod; the mockery, the scourging, the railing
crowd, the dying Jesus, and the parting prayer, "Father,
into Thy hands I commend My spirit."</p>

<p>So far the Apostle speaks of the example of Christ,
which, though far above and beyond us, we are exhorted
and called on to follow. And there are many
who will go with him thus far who value our Lord's
work only for its lofty example. Indeed, it is characteristic
of those who deny the mediatorial office of
Christ to be loudest in magnifying the grandeur of His
character. To His good works, His love for men, His
spotless life, His noble lessons, they accord untiring
praise, as though thereby they would atone for denying
Him that office which is more glorious still. But St.
Peter stops at no such half-way house. He knows in
whom he has believed, knows Him for the Son of the
living God, a Teacher with whom were the words of
eternal life. So in pregnant words he sets forth the
doctrine of the Atonement as the end of Christ's
suffering: <em>Who His own self bare our sins in His own
body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
<em>live unto righteousness</em>. He bare our sins. The words
tell of something beyond our powers to comprehend;
but some light is shed on them by a kindred passage
(Matt. viii. 17), where the Evangelist applies to the
work of Jesus those other words from Isa. liii.,
"Himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses."
The narrative in the Gospel has just recorded how
Jesus wrought many miracles. First a leper was
healed, then the centurion's servant, next Simon's
wife's mother, and afterwards many sick and demoniacs
beside. There is no record here of the effect produced
on Jesus Himself by these exhibitions of miraculous
power, but from other passages in the Gospels we do
find that He was conscious in Himself of a demand on
His power when such cures were wrought. Thus we
are told, at the cure of the woman with the issue, that
Jesus perceived in Himself that the power proceeding
from Him had gone forth (Mark v. 30); and again when
many were cured, that "power came forth from Him
and healed them all" (Luke vi. 19). Of the woman
Jesus says expressly, "Thy faith hath made thee
whole"; and the manifestation of eagerness to touch
Jesus is a sign of the faith of the others whom the
Divine power blessed with health.</p>

<p>The Bible recognises everywhere the analogy between
sin and sickness. May we not trace some analogy
between the Lord's works of healing and that mightier
deliverance from sin won by Christ upon the cross, an
analogy which may help, if but a little, to give meaning
to the bearing by Christ of human sins? A power
went forth when the sick were healed; and through
that imparted power they were restored to health, faith
being the pathway which brought the Divine virtue to
their aid. Thus Jesus bore their diseases and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
them away. Look through this figure on the work of
our redemption. Christ has borne the burden of sin.
He has died for sin that men may die from sin, that
sin may be slain in us, the fell disease healed by the
power of His suffering. We cannot comprehend what
was done for the sick when Christ was on earth, nor
what is wrought for sinners by His grace in heaven.
Those alone who reap the blessing know its certainty;
and they can but say, as the blind man whose sight
was restored, "One thing I know: that, whereas I was
blind, now I see" (John ix. 25).</p>

<p>To this teaching, that Christ's suffering wrought
man's rescue, St. Peter adds emphasis by another
quotation from that chapter of Isaiah which he has so
much in mind: <em>by whose stripes ye were healed</em>. Christ
was stricken, and God grants to His sufferings a power
to heal the souls of those whom He loves because
they strive to love Him. Healing through wounds!
Soundness through that which speaks only of injury!
Mysterious dispensation! But long ago it had been
foreshadowed, and shown also how little connexion
there was to be, except through faith, between the
remedy and the disease. Those who were bitten of
the serpents in the wilderness gazed on the brazen
serpent, and were healed. In the dead brass was no
virtue, but God was pleased to make of it a speaking
sacrament; so has it pleased Him to give healing of
sins to those who by faith appropriate the sacrifice on
Calvary. Christ has claimed the type for Himself:
"I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
unto Myself" (John xii. 32).</p>

<p>And now, as is so often his wont, St. Peter varies
the figure. The wounded sinner finding cure becomes
the wandering sheep that has been brought back into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the fold: <em>For ye were going astray like sheep, but are
now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your
souls</em>. But the message, the teaching, the love, is all
the same. He who before was the great Exemplar,
whose footsteps we should follow, is now the Shepherd,
the Good Shepherd, who goes before His sheep. This
Shepherd has been a Sufferer, too. He has given
Himself up as a prey to the wolves that His flock
might be saved. Now, with a voice of love, He calls
His sheep by name; and hearing, they follow Him.</p>

<p>But He is more than this. Brought within the fold,
the sheep still need His care; and it is freely given.
He is the Bishop, the Overseer, the Watchman for His
people's safety, who, having gathered them within the
fold, tends them with constant watchfulness. The
figure passes over thus into the reality in the Apostle's
closing words. The cure which the great Healer
desires to accomplish is in the souls of men. For
them His care is bestowed, first to bring them safe out
of the way of evil, then for ever to keep them under
the sheltering care of His abundant love.</p>

<h3><em>CHRISTIAN WIVES AND HUSBANDS</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"In like manner, ye wives, <em>be</em> in subjection to your own husbands;
that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word
be gained by the behaviour of their wives; beholding your chaste
behaviour <em>coupled</em> with fear. Whose <em>adorning</em> let it not be the outward
adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of
putting on apparel; but <em>let it be</em> the hidden man of the heart, in the
incorruptible <em>apparel</em> of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight
of God of great price. For after this manner aforetime the holy
women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection
to their own husbands: as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him
lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in
fear by any terror.</p>

<p>"Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with <em>your wives</em> according to
knowledge, giving honour unto the woman, as unto the weaker
vessel, as being also joint heirs of the grace of life; to the end that
your prayers be not hindered."&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> iii. 1-7.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Apostle gave at first (ii. 13) the rule of Christian
submission generally; then proceeded to
apply it to the cases of citizens and of servants. In
the same way he now gives injunctions concerning the
behaviour of wives and husbands. The precept with
which he began holds good for them also. <em>In like
manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands.</em>
The life and teaching of Jesus had wrought a great
change in the position of women, a change which can
be observed from the earliest days of Christianity. We
can gather in what estimation women were generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
held among the Jews at that time from the expression
used in the account of our Lord's interview with the
woman of Samaria. There it is said (John iv. 27) that
the disciples marvelled that Jesus was talking with a
woman. Such a feeling must afterwards have been
entirely dispelled, for all through the earthly life of
Christ we find Him attended by women who ministered
unto Him; we read of His close friendship with Mary
and Martha, and are told, at the time of His death
(Matt. xxvii. 55), that many women beheld the Crucifixion
afar off, having followed Him from Galilee.
Women were the earliest visitors to the tomb on the
great Easter morning, and to them, among the first
(Luke xxiv. 22), was the Lord's resurrection made
known.</p>

<p>We are not surprised, therefore, in the history of the
infant Church, to read (Acts i. 14) that women were
present among the disciples who waited at Jerusalem
for the promise of the Father, nor to learn how the
daughters of Philip the evangelist (Acts xxi. 9) took
a share in the labours of their father for the cause of
Christ, or that Priscilla (Acts xviii. 26), equally with
her husband, was active in Christian good offices.
Other examples occur in the Acts of the Apostles:
Dorcas, Lydia, and the mother of Timothy; and the
constant mention of women which we find in the
salutations with which St. Paul concludes his letters
makes it clear how large a part they played in the
early propagation of the faith. "Fellow-workers,"
"servants of the Church," "labourers in the Lord,"
are among the terms which the Apostle applies to them;
and we know from the Pastoral Epistles what help
the primitive Church derived from the labours of its
deaconesses and widows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>To be occupied in such duties was sure to give to
women an influence which they had never possessed
before; and the women converts, in countries such
as these Asiatic provinces, were exposed to the same
sort of danger which beset the slave population at
their acceptance of the Christian faith. They might
begin to think meanly of others, even of their own
husbands, if they were still content to abide in heathenism.
Such women might incline at times to take
counsel for their life's guidance with Christian men
among the various congregations to which they belonged
and to set a value on their advice above any which
they could obtain from their own husbands. They
might come to entertain doubts also whether they ought
to maintain the relations of married life with their
heathen partners. With the knowledge that such cases
might occur, St. Peter gives his lesson. And as in the
case of slaves, so here, he gives no countenance to the
idea that to become a Christian breaks off previous
relations. Wives, though they have accepted the faith,
have wifely duties still. Like Christian citizens living
in a heathen commonwealth, they are not by religion
released from their previously contracted obligations;
they are to abide in their estate, and use it, if it may
be done, for the furtherance of the cause of Christ.
Be in subjection to <em>your own</em> husbands; they have still
their claim on your duty.</p>

<p>There is much gentleness in the Apostle's next
words. He knows that there may arise cases where
believing wives have husbands who are heathen. But
he speaks hopefully, as thinking they would not be of
frequent occurrence: <em>even if any obey not the word</em>.
Wives, especially if they be of such a character as the
Apostle would have them be, could not have been won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to the faith of Christ without much converse with their
husbands on so deep a subject; and the word which
was working effectually in the one would often have
its influence with the other. It might not always be
so. But husbands, though not obeying the word as
yet, are not to be despaired of.</p>

<p>And here we may turn aside to dwell on the tone of
hope in which St. Peter speaks of these husbands who
obey not. For the word &#7936;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#952;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;, by which they
are described, is the same that is used in ii. 18 of those
who stumble at the word, being disobedient. The
lesson here given to Christian wives, not to despair
of winning their husbands for Christ, gives warrant
for what was said on the former passage: that the disobedience
which causes men to stumble need not last
for ever, nor imply final obduracy and rejection from
God's grace. But this by the way.</p>

<p>The Apostle adds the strongest motive to confirm
wives in holding to their married state: <em>That the husbands
may without the word be gained by the behaviour
of their wives: beholding your chaste behaviour coupled
with fear</em>. "Without the word" here means that there
is to be no discussion. They are so to live as to make
their lives a sermon without words, to work conviction
without debate; then, when the victory is won, there
will remain no trace of combat: all will tell of gain, and
nothing of loss.</p>

<p>And once again St. Peter uses his special word
(&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#960;&#964;&#8051;&#965;&#949;&#953;&#957;) as he describes how the husbands shall
be affected by the behaviour of their wives. They
shall gaze on it as a mystery, the key to which they
do not possess. The wives in heathen homes must
have been obliged to hear and see many things which
were grievous and distasteful. The husbands could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hardly fail to know that it was so. If, then, they still
found wifely regard and respect, wifely submission,
with no assertion of a law of their own, no comparison
of the lives of Christian men with those of their own
husbands, if a silent, consistent walk were all the
protest which the Christian wives offered against their
heathen environments, such a life could hardly fail of
its effect. There must be a powerful motive, a mighty,
strengthening power, that enabled women to abide uncomplainingly
in their estate. For this the husbands
would surely search, and in their search would learn
secrets to which they were strangers, would learn how
the tongue was restrained where remonstrance might
seem more natural, how pure life was maintained in
spite of temptations to laxity, and the marriage bond
exalted with religious observance even when reverence
for the husband was meeting with no equal return.
Such lives would be more powerful than oratory, have a
charm beyond resistance, would win the husbands first
to wonder, then to praise, and in the end to imitation.</p>

<p>And from describing the grace of such a life the
Apostle turns to contrast it with other adornments of
which the world thinks highly. <em>Whose adorning</em>, he
says, <em>let it not be the outward adorning of plaiting the hair,
and of wearing jewels of gold, and of putting on apparel</em>.
We can see from the catalogue in Isaiah (iii. 18-23)
that the daughters of Zion in old days had gone to
great lengths in this outside bravery, and provoked the
Lord to smite them. These had forgotten the simplicity
of Sarah. But that in the house of Abraham there
were found no such ornaments is hardly to be believed.
The patriarch, who sent (Gen. xxiv. 53) to Rebekah
jewels of silver and jewels of gold, did not leave his
own wife unadorned. Nor does the language of St. Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
condemn Rebekah's bracelets, if they be worn with
Rebekah's modesty. The New Testament does not
teach us to neglect or despise the body. A misrendering
in the Authorised Version, "Who shall change our
vile body" (Phil. iii. 21), has long seemed to lend
countenance to such a notion. It is one of the gains
of the Revised Version that we now read in that place,
"Who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation."
Sin has robbed the body of its primal dignity, but it is
to be restored and made like unto the body of Christ's
glory. And He did not despise the body when He
deigned to wear it that He might draw nearer unto us.
If these things be present to our thoughts, we shall
seek to bestow on the body whatever may make it
comely. The mischief arises when the adornment of
the outer brings neglect of the inner man, when fine
apparel has for its companions the haughtiness, the
stretched-forth necks, and wanton eyes which Isaiah
rebukes. Then it is that it rightly comes under condemnation.
When the jewel is (as Rebekah's was) the
gift of some dear one&mdash;a parent, a husband, a near
kinsman&mdash;it rouses grateful reminiscences, and may
fitly be prized, and holily worn, and ranked near to
the rings of betrothal and of marriage.</p>

<p>Let these be the feelings which regulate womanly
adornment, and it may be made a part of the culture
of the heart, the inner man, which St. Peter urges the
Christian wives to be careful to adorn: Let your
adorning <em>be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible
apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is
in the sight of God of great price</em>. All Scripture regards
man as of twofold nature, the outward and the inward,
of which the latter is the more precious. He is a Jew
who is one inwardly (Rom. ii. 29); the inward man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
delighteth in the law of God (Rom. vii. 22); while
the outward man perishes the inward man may be
renewed day by day (2 Cor. iv. 16), being strengthened
with power through God's Spirit. This hidden
man is the centre from which all the strength of
Christian life comes. Let this be rightly adorned,
and the outward life will need no strict rules; there
will be no fear of excess, least of all when the inner
life is cared for because it is precious before God.
Its pure array passeth gold and gems, be they ever
so beautiful. This is a grace which never fades, but
will flourish through eternity.</p>

<p>The Apostle proceeds to commend it by a noble
example. The Old Testament Scriptures do not dwell
largely on the lives of women, but a study of what
is said will oftentimes reveal deeper meaning in the
record and put force into a solitary word. The
writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews couples Sarah
with Abraham in the list of heroes and heroines of
faith, and St. Peter from a single word finds a text
to extol the submission which she showed to her
husband. He probably refers to Gen. xviii. 12, where
she gives the title of "lord" to Abraham, as Rachel
in another place (Gen. xxxi. 35) does to her father
Laban: <em>For after this manner aforetime the holy
women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves,
being in subjection to their own husbands: as Sarah
obeyed Abraham, calling him lord</em>. A Scripture example
which has more in common with the experience
of the Asian women is the life of Hannah. Her lot,
for a time at least, was as full of grief and disappointment
as theirs could be; but her trust in God was
unshaken. Her patience under provocation was
exemplary, while the picture of her home life is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
full of touching affection on the part of both husband
and wife; and the mother's gratitude, when her
prayer was granted, is set forth in her noble hymn
of thanksgiving and in the devotion of her child to the
service of the God who had bestowed him. Ruth is
another of those holy women who must have been
in St. Peter's thoughts, who, though not of the house
of Israel, manifested virtues in her life which made her
fit to be the ancestress of King David. The Apostle,
however, seems to have had a purpose in his special
mention of Sarah. As the sons of Israel looked back
to Abraham and to the covenant sealed with him, yea,
not seldom prided themselves on being his children,
so the daughters of Israel counted themselves as
Sarah's daughters after the flesh. St. Peter now
gives them another ground for that claim. God's promises
to Abraham have been fulfilled in Christ, and so
Christian Jewesses are more truly than ever daughters
of Sarah. <em>Whose children ye now are.</em> But to the
heathen converts the same door was opened. They
by their faith were now made partakers of the ancient
covenant. They too were become Sarah's daughters.
Let them, one and all, continue in the well-doing which
has been commended; let it be seen in the daily round
(&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8052;) of their lives, led in quietness and
humility. The excessive love of adornment against
which they are warned marks a condition of boldness
and unrest. But unrest may enter into the other
actions of their life. Their behaviour is to be coupled
with fear and reverence, but it should eschew everything
which partakes of flighty irregularity. It should
be steady and consistent, running into no extremes
either of humiliation or the contrary. <em>Do well, and be
not put in fear by any terror.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The Apostle now addresses Christian husbands. In
his counsel to subjects and slaves he has not dwelt on
the duties of rulers and masters. Perhaps he judged
it unlikely that his letter would come to the hands of
many such, or it may be he thought the lessons which
he had to give were more needed by the subject
people, if Christ's cause were to be furthered. But
with husbands and wives life has of necessity a great
deal in common, and the one partner can hardly receive
counsel which is not of interest to the other. To the
wives the Apostle spake as though examples of unbelieving
husbands might be rare. Christian husbands
with unbelieving wives he hardly seems to contemplate.
We know from St. Paul (1 Cor. vii. 16) that there
were such. But doubtless heathen wives hearkened
to Christian husbands more readily than heathen
husbands to their Christian wives. The husbands are
to use their position as heads of their wives with
judgement and discretion: <em>Dwell with your wives according
to knowledge</em>. The knowledge of which St. Peter
speaks is not religious, godly, Christian knowledge,
but that foresight and thoughtfulness which the responsibility
of the husband calls for. He will understand
what things for his wife's sake he should do
or leave undone. This knowledge, which results in
considerate conduct towards her, will manifest itself in
Christian chivalry. The woman is physically the
feebler of the two. No burden beyond her powers
will be laid upon her; and by reason of her weaker
nature regard and honour will be felt to be her due.
For the woman is the glory of the man (1 Cor. xi. 7).
Such observance will not degenerate into undue adulation
nor foolish fondness, apt to foster pride and conceit,
but will be inspired by the sense that in God's creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman
without the man.</p>

<p>But beyond and above these daily graces of domestic
and social intercourse, the Apostle would have husband
and wife knit together by a higher bond. They are
<em>joint heirs of the grace of life</em>. Both are meant to be
partakers of the heavenly inheritance, and such participation
makes their chief duty here to be preparation
for the life to come. Those who are bound together
not by wedlock only, but by the hope of a common
salvation, will find a motive in that thought to help
each other in life's pilgrimage, each to shun all that
might cause the other to stumble: <em>That your prayers
be not hindered</em>. They are fellow-travellers with the
same needs. Together they can bring their requests
before God, and where the two join in heart and
soul Christ has promised to be present as the
Third. And in praying they will know one another's
necessities. This is the grandest knowledge the husband
can attain to for the honouring of his wife; and
using it, he will speed their united supplications to the
throne of grace, and the union of hearts will not fail of
its blessing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Finally, <em>be</em> ye all like-minded, compassionate, loving as brethren,
tender-hearted, humble-minded: not rendering evil for evil, or reviling
for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye
called, that ye should inherit a blessing. For he that would love
life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and
his lips that they speak no guile: and let him turn away from evil,

the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears unto their supplication:
but the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil. And who is he
that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good? But and

not their fear, neither be troubled; but sanctify in your hearts Christ

asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with
meekness and fear: having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are
spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good
manner of life in Christ."&mdash;1 Peter iii. 8-16.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Apostle now ceases from his special admonitions,
and enforces generally such qualities and
conduct as must mark all who fear the Lord. <em>Finally</em>,
he says&mdash;and the word may indicate the close of his
counsels; but the virtues which he inculcates are of
so important a character that he may very well intend
them as the apex and crown of all his previous advice&mdash;<em>be
ye all like-minded, compassionate, loving as brethren,
tender-hearted, humble-minded</em>. St. Peter has here
grouped together a number of epithets of which all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
but one are only used in the New Testament by himself,
and they are of that graphic character which is so
conspicuous in all the Apostle's language. <em>Like-minded.</em>
If the word be not there, the spirit is largely exemplified
in the early history of the Church. How often we
hear the phrase "with one accord" in the opening
chapters of the Acts. Thus the disciples continued in
prayer (i. 14); thus they went daily to the Temple
(ii. 46); thus they lifted up their voices to God (iv. 24),
for all they that believed were of one heart and one
soul (iv. 32). Such lives exhibit harmony of thought,
the same aim and purpose. The men may not, will
not, always use the same means or follow the same
methods, but they will all be seeking one result. Such
unity is worth more than uniformity. <em>Compassionate.</em>
This feeling St. Paul describes (Rom. xii. 15) as rejoicing
with them that do rejoice and weeping with them
that weep. For the &#960;&#945;&#952;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; of this life are not
always sorrowful, though the best of them are not
worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be
revealed (Rom. viii. 18).<em>Loving as brethren.</em> The
sense of the brotherhood of Christians is strongly
marked in all the New Testament Scriptures. It is
the name by which our Lord claims fellowship with
men, being not ashamed to call them brethren. It is
the designation of the Christian body from the first
(Matt. xxiii. 8), is constantly found in the Acts and the
Epistles (Acts vi. 3, ix. 30, xi. 29), and has been used
of the Church in every age, marking how as one family
we dwell in Him. Next comes the word which is not
St. Peter's alone: <em>Tender-hearted</em>. St. Paul has it (Eph.
iv. 32), but it is no Greek notion. It was a Jewish
idea that deep feeling was closely connected with some
of the organs of the body; and in the Old Testament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
as in the story of Joseph (Gen. xliii. 30) and elsewhere
(1 Kings iii. 26), we come upon such phrases as "His
bowels did yearn upon his brother." This Hebrew notion
the LXX. has conveyed into Greek by the word which
St. Peter here uses, and which those translators had
used and consecrated long before. For them so exalted
was the thought contained in it that they employ it in
the prayer of Manasses (ver. 7) to express the tenderness
of God towards the penitent, the yearning love of
the Father, who sees the prodigal afar off, and has
compassion. <em>Humble-minded.</em> This word and those
akin to it are almost a New Testament creation. The
heathen had no admiration for the temper it expresses,
and where they do use the word it is in a bad sense
as signifying "cowardly" and "mean-spirited." Before
Christ none had taught, "He that is greatest among
you shall be your servant" (Matt. xxiii. 11).</p>

<p>It is manifest that if such harmony, kind feeling,
attachment, affection, and humility flourished among
believers, these virtues would put discord to the rout,
and leave no occasion for rending the oneness of the
Christian body. They would also be proof against
evil from without, both in deed and speech, neither
tempted to <em>render evil for evil</em> in their actions nor
<em>reviling for reviling</em> in their words. They have a duty
to the world, and cannot thus belie their Christian
profession. They are called to adorn the doctrine of
their Saviour, and the Master's sermon has among its
prominent precepts "Bless them that curse you."
This is the spirit of St. Peter's exhortation, <em>But contrariwise
blessing</em>; that is, Be ye of those who bless.
For there is a law of recompense with God in good
things as in evil; the blessers shall be blessed: <em>For
hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
It is as though he urged them thus: Ye were aforetime
enemies of God; but ye have been made partakers
of His heavenly calling (Heb. iii. 1), that ye may
come to blessing. This should move you to bless
your enemies. And more than this, the servant of
God may receive no blessing from the world, may get
curses for his blessing; but yet he knows where to
flee for consolation. He can pray with the Psalmist,
"Let them curse, but bless Thou" (Psalm cix. 28),
conscious that the Lord will stand at the right hand of
the needy.</p>

<p>The psalmists knew much of such trials, and it is
from the words of one of them (Psalm xxxiv. 12-16)
that St. Peter enforces his own lesson. It is a psalm
full of the knowledge of the trials of God's servants:
"Many are the afflictions of the righteous"; but it is
rich also in plenitude of comfort: "The Lord
delivereth him out of them all." The father of long ago
teaches thus to his children the fear of the Lord: <em>He
that would love life, and see good days, let him refrain
his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no
guile: and let him turn away from evil, and do good;
let him seek peace, and pursue it</em>. <em>For the eyes of the
Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears unto their
supplication: but the face of the Lord is upon them that
do evil.</em> A glance at the Psalm will show that the
Apostle has not quoted precisely; and though he has
much in common with the Greek of the LXX., he does
not adhere closely to that. But he gives to the full
the spirit both of the Hebrew and the Greek. The
life of which the Psalmist speaks is life in this world.
The original explains this by making the latter clause
of the verse, "and loveth <em>many</em> days, that he may
see good." And the love is to be a noble feeling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
a desire to make his worth living. Such a life must
exhibit watchfulness over words and actions. The
precepts begin at the beginning, with control of the
tongue. Control that, and you are master of the rest.
"It is a little member, but boasteth great things." "The
world of iniquity among our members is the tongue,
which defileth the whole body" (James iii. 5, 6). It
needs to be kept as with a bridle, and not only when
the ungodly are in sight, but constantly. But the
words of the Psalm contemplate a further danger.
Men may give good words with the lips while the
heart is full of bitterness. Then the lips are lying,
and this is an evil as great as the former, and more
perilous to him who commits it, because the sin does
not come to the light that it may be reproved, but
contrives to wear the mask of virtue.</p>

<p>And the actions need watchfulness also. They must
not only possess the negative quality of abstinence
from evil, but the positive stamp of good deeds done.
"By their fruits ye shall know them." And the work
will be no light one. Peace is to be sought, and the
Apostle uses a word which implies that a chase is
needful to obtain it. St. Paul has a passage very
much in the spirit of St. Peter's teaching here, and the
words of which picture distinctly the difficulties which
the Christian will have to labour against: "Giving
diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace" (Eph. iv. 3). This tells us why our Apostle
urges the pursuit of peace. It is the clasp which binds
the Christian communion together. From all sorts of
causes men are prone to fall apart, to break the oneness;
and peace is able to hold them fast. Hence the
diligence in seeking it, the earnestness of the pursuit
that it may not elude us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>But when all is done, when men have not been
sitting with folded hands waiting and dreaming that
peace would come without pursuit, but have laboured
for it, they do not always attain to it. "I am for
peace," says the Psalmist, "but when I speak, they are
for war" (Psalm cxx. 7). And so the disappointed
struggler is directed to the sure source of consolation
amid discomfiture. The Lord marks his efforts, knows
their earnest purpose in spite of their ill-success. He
beholds also those who have withstood them, but with
far other regard. St. Peter has not quoted what the
Psalmist says of their fate: "God will root out the
remembrance of them from the earth." God's righteous
pilgrim is not forgotten. His prayer is heard, and will
be answered for good. No shadow has come between
him and God, though his lot seem very dark. Neither
can the wrong-doer raise a shadow to screen himself
from the all-seeing eyes. All things are naked and
open before the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.</p>

<p>Thus far St. Peter has used the language of the
Psalmist, and among the converts the Jews would be
sure to supply from the context those other words, "O
fear the Lord, all ye His saints; for they that fear
Him lack nothing." The Apostle clothes that same
thought in his own words: <em>And who is he that will
harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good?</em> He
has repeatedly dwelt on the power of goodness to win
unbelievers to its side (ii. 12, 15; iii. 1), and the same
idea shapes his words now. In those days the Zealots
were well known, and their unbounded enthusiasm for
their evil cause. Josephus lays the destruction of
Jerusalem at their door. The Apostle would have
Christ's disciples "zealots" for Him. Let there be
nothing half-hearted in their service, and its power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
will be irresistible. It will avail either to silence and
confound the adversaries, or to strengthen the faithful
so that the smell of the furnace of persecution shall not
pass upon them. They shall be enabled to break the
chains with which their foes would bind them as easily
as Samson his green withes. <em>But and if ye should
suffer for righteousness' sake, blessed are ye.</em> If ye
endure chastening, God is dealing with you as with
sons. He has called Himself your Father; Christ has
claimed you for brethren. He, the righteous, suffered;
shall we not reckon it for a blessing to be worthy to
bear the cross? Only let us be of good courage. He
that endureth to the end shall find salvation. <em>And
fear not their fear, neither be troubled.</em> Again St. Peter
applies the promises of the ancient Scriptures. In the
days of Isaiah all Judah was in terror, king and people
alike, before the gathering armies of Syria and Israel.
In their dread comes the prophetic message, and says
to the confederates, "Gird yourselves, and ye shall be
broken in pieces," and to the tiny power of Judah,
"Let the Lord of hosts be your fear, and let Him
be your dread, and He shall be for a sanctuary"
(Isa. viii. 12, 13). The condition of these Asian converts
was one of heaviness through manifold temptations.
While the believer lives here he always has his
assailants, and in those early days the rulers of the
earth were not seldom among the adversaries of the
Christians. Hence the Apostle's exhortation is most
apposite: Fear not their fear&mdash;the things which they
would dread, and with which they will threaten you.
For what are they? They may take away your property.
Be not troubled; you would soon have had to leave it.
The loss a few years sooner is no terrible affliction.
They may drive you from one land to another. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
strangers and sojourners what can that signify? If
they cast you into prison, the Lord who shut the lions'
mouths for Daniel is your Lord also; and I, Peter,
know how angel-hands have removed chains and
opened prison doors. And should they scourge and
torture you, do you shrink from thus being made like
unto your Master? <em>Sanctify in your hearts Christ as
Lord.</em></p>

<p>Isaiah's message to disheartened Judah was, "The
Lord of hosts, Him shall ye sanctify." On His word
shall ye rely, assured that He, the holy God, will fail
neither in wisdom nor power. To think otherwise
is not to sanctify Him. The Lord knoweth how to
deliver out of temptation. St. Peter, who knew Christ
as the Son of the living God, applies to the Son the
words first spoken of the Father. The Son is one
with the Father. Hence he bids the afflicted converts,
suffering for righteousness' sake, not to be afraid of
the world's terror, but to sanctify Christ in their hearts
as Lord. He is the Emmanuel, whom Isaiah was sent
to promise. God has dwelt among men, and will be the
God and the Deliverer of all His faithful ones. This
sense of "God with us" they know, and with the
knowledge comes a power not their own, and they
fear no more the fear of their adversaries.</p>

<p>It is against foes of another sort that the Christian
has now to hold fast his faith, and sanctify Christ as
his Lord. There are those who deny Him all that
is supernatural, all that speaks of the Divine in His
history; who treat the resurrection and ascension of
the Lord as groundless legends, due to the ignorance
of His followers; and who leave to the Jesus of the
Gospels only the qualities of a better fellow-man.
These are the enemies of the cross of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>And of such dangerous teaching it would seem as
if St. Peter had been thinking in the words that follow:
<em>Being ready always to give answer to every man that
asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you.</em>
The believer rests on Christ in faith. But though in
his belief there must be much which he cannot fathom,
yet it is a belief for men. His service is a reasonable
service; he can point to abundance of evidence as
ground for his faith; he believes because he has
experienced the power of the Spirit, and fears not to
trust the Christ whom he has sanctified in his heart
as Lord; he knows in whom he has believed. But
beside this, he can study the Old Testament; and
there he learns how the coming incarnation dominates
every portion of the volume, how from the first
redemption through the seed of the woman was made
known; and he follows the revelation step by step
till in the evangel of Isaiah he has predictions almost
as vivid and plain as the narrative of the Gospels.
Those four narratives are another warrant for his
faith, their wondrous agreement amid multitudinous
divergences, divergences so marked that none could
have ventured to put them forth as history except
while the knowledge of those who had seen the Lord
and been witnesses of His actions was available
to vouch for and stamp as true these varicoloured
pictures of the life of Jesus. He has further vouchers
in the lives and letters of those who knew and followed
the Lord, followed Him, most of them, on the road
that led through persecution unto death. And beside
all this, there stands and grows the Church built upon
this history, strong with the power of this faith and
in her holy worship sanctifying Christ as her Lord.
These are things to which the Christian appeals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
They are not the only reasons for belief, but they are
those of which he can make other men cognisant,
and to which the world cannot continue always blind;
and they have a force against which the gates of hell
have not yet been, nor ever will be able, to prevail.</p>

<p>These reasons he gives <em>with meekness and fear</em>&mdash;with
meekness, because in that spirit all the victories
of the Lord are to be won; with fear, lest by feeble
advocacy the cause of Christ may suffer. And he does
not bring words alone with him to the struggle, but
the power of a godly life; he is prepared for the
conflict by the possession of a <em>good conscience</em> before
God and men; he bears in mind the prophetic exhortation,
"Be ye clean, ye that bear the vessels of
the Lord" (Isa. lii. 11). That injunction was given
to those who were in their day strangers and pilgrims.
But with the good conscience, pureness of heart in the
service of the Lord, there need be no haste, no flight.
The Lord will go before them; the God of Israel will
be their rearward. And the good conscience has lost
none of its efficacy: <em>Wherein ye are spoken against,
they may be put to shame who revile your good manner
of life in Christ</em>. Of the Christian's faith and hope his
revilers know nothing, but his good life and his
reasons for it men can see and hear. And these shall
gain the victory. But they must go hand in hand.
The deeds must bear out the words. When he testifies
that his hope is placed where neither persecutions nor
revilings avail against it, his life must show him fearless
of what the world can do. His position toward it
must be that which St. Peter himself took: "Whether
it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you
more than unto God, judge ye" (Acts iv. 19). Men
may marvel at what they see in him, but they will take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
knowledge that he has been with Jesus. He is
created, new-created, in Christ Jesus unto good works
(Eph. ii. 10). His revilers use him despitefully; but,
according to Christ's lesson, he prays for them, and
their shafts glance pointless off. Well does St. Paul
close his catalogue of the Christian armour "with all
prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the
Spirit" (Eph. vi. 18). Thus does the believer wield
his weapons effectually. His revilers have no reason
for their words; he is careful that they shall have
none. As with Peter and John the council could say
nothing against their good deed and let them go,
finding nothing how they might punish them, so shall
it be with others of the faithful; and, for very shame
at the futility of their accusations and assaults, the
revilers shall be put to silence.</p>

<h3><em>THE REWARDS OF SUFFERING FOR WELL-DOING</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer
for well-doing than for evil-doing. Because Christ also suffered for
sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring us
to God; being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit;
in which also He went and preached unto the spirits in prison, which
aforetime were disobedient, when the long-suffering of God waited in
the days of Noah, while the ark was a-preparing, wherein few, that
is, eight souls, were saved through water: which also after a true
likeness doth now save you, <em>even</em> baptism, not the putting away
of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience
toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ; who is on the
right hand of God, having gone unto heaven; angels and authorities
and powers being made subject unto Him."&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> iii. 17-22.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Apostle comes back to his solemn subject.
Why are the righteous called to suffering? The
question was perplexing these Asian Christians when
St. Peter wrote. Previous ages had pondered over
it, Job and his friends among the number; and men
ponder over it still. St. Peter has suggested several
answers: The faith of Christ's servants after trial
will be found praiseworthy at the appearance of their
Lord; to bear wrong with patience is acceptable with
God; it is a happy lot, Christ has said, to suffer
in the cause of righteousness. His next response to
the question is more solemn than these: Suffering is
sent to the righteous by the will of God. It never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
comes otherwise, and is meant to serve two several
purposes: it is intended to benefit the unrighteous,
and to be a blessing and glory to the righteous who
endure it.</p>

<p>He shows that this is God's will by two examples.
Christ, the sinless, suffered at the hands of sinful men,
and for their sakes, as well as for all sinners; and though
we only can approach the subject with deep reverence
and use the language of Scripture rather than our own
about the effect of suffering on Christ Himself, we
are taught therein that He was made perfect as the
Leader of salvation by the things which He suffered:
and the Apostle here describes the sequel of those
sufferings by the session on the right hand of God
in heaven, where angels and authorities and powers
are made subject unto Him.</p>

<p>But God's ordinance in respect of the suffering of
the godly has been the same from of old. In the
ancient world Noah had found grace in God's sight
in the midst of a graceless world. He was made a
witness and a preacher of righteousness; and the faithful
building of the ark at God's command was a
constant testimony to the wrong-doers, whose sole
response was mockery and a continuance in the corruption
of their way. But God had not left them
without witness; and when the Deluge came at length,
some hearts may have gone forth to God in penitence,
though too late to be saved from the destruction. To
Noah and those with him safety was assured; and
when the door of the ark was opened, and the small
band of the rescued came forth, it was to have the
welcome of God's blessing and to be pointed to a
token of His everlasting covenant. In this wise St.
Peter adds once more to the consolations of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
endure grief and suffering wrongfully, and thus does
he set forth the general drift of his argument. But
the whole passage is so replete with helpful lessons
that it merits the fullest consideration.</p>

<p><em>For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that
ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.</em> For evil-doing
suffering is certain to come. It cannot be
escaped. God has linked the two together by an unalterable
law. Such suffering is penal. But when the
righteous are afflicted their lot is not of law, but of
God's merciful appointment and selection, and is
ordained with a purpose of blessing both to themselves
and others. The words of St. Peter are very emphatic
concerning God's ordinance: <em>If the will of God so
will</em>. It is not always clear to men. Therefore St.
Paul (Eph. i. 9) speaks of the mystery of the Divine
will, but in the same place (i. 5) of the good pleasure
thereof. It is exercised with love, and not with anger.
It was the feeling<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> with which God looked forth upon
the new-created world, and, behold, it was very good
(Rev. iv. 11). With the same feeling He longs to
behold it rescued and restored. Such is the desire,
such the aim, with which God permits trial and
distress to fall upon the righteous. And that the
sufferers may be kept in mind of God's remedial purpose
herein, the Apostle adduces the example of Christ
Himself: <em>Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the
righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring us to
God</em>. The suffering Christ should give pause to all
questionings about the sufferings of His servants.
Their lot may be hard to explain. But be their lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
ever so pure, their purposes ever so lofty, "in many
things we offend all," and need not murmur if we be
chastened. But as we think of the sinless Jesus and
His unequalled sufferings, we learn the applicability
of the prophet's lamentation, "See if there be any
sorrow like unto my sorrow" (Lam. i. 12). The
burden of the unrighteous world was laid upon the
righteous Son of God, and this because of God's love
for sinners. Herein was the love of God manifested
in us. Sinful men were the material chosen for the
display of the Divine love, and God sent His only-begotten
Son into the world that we might live through
Him. It was of God's ordinance and the Son's
obedience that redemption was thus purchased. That
we might live, the sinless Christ must die, and ere
He died must be put to grief by the opposition of those
whom He came to save; must lament and be hindered
in His works of mercy by the want of faith among His
own kindred, by the persistent sins of those cities in
which His mightiest works were wrought; must shed
tears of anguish over the city of David, which would
know nothing of the things which belonged unto her
peace. This was the chastisement of the innocent to
gain peace for the guilty, that God might thus commend
His love to men, and Christ might bring them
back to the Father. And this bringing back is not the
mere action of a guide. This He is, but He is far
more: He helps those who are coming at every step,
and as they draw near they find through Him that the
Father's house and the Father's welcome are waiting
for their return. Shall men complain, nay shall they
not be lost in praise, if God will at all consent to use
their trials to extend His kingdom and His glory, and
thus make them partakers of the sufferings of Christ?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Such a lot had been welcome to St. Peter: "They
departed from the presence of the council rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour for
the name" (Acts v. 41); and here in his epistle he
publishes the joy of such shame, publishes it that
others through all ages may suffer gladly, trusting
their God to use the pains He sends to magnify His
glory. The lesson is for all men at all times. Christ
suffered for sins once; but once here means once
for all, and proclaims to each generation of sinners
that Jesus bore His cross for them.</p>

<p><em>Being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the
spirit.</em> The suffering of Jesus went thus far, that there
might be nothing in the cup of human woe which He
had not tasted. His spirit was parted from the flesh,
as when we die. The body lay in the grave; the
spirit passed to the world of the departed. But the
triumph of death was short. After the three days'
burial came the miracle of miracles. The dead Jesus
returned to life, and that resurrection is made the
earnest of a future life to all believers. Thus began
the recompense of the righteous Sufferer, and the
power of the resurrection makes suffering endurable
to the godly, makes them rejoice to be conformed unto
Christ's death and forgetful of all things save the
prize of the high calling, which lies before them to be
won. Nor was it with Christ's spirit during those
three days as with the souls of other departed ones.
He, the sinless One, had no judgement to await; His
stay there was that dwelling in paradise which He
foreknew and spake of to the penitent thief.</p>

<p><em>In which also He went and preached unto the spirits in
prison, which aforetime were disobedient, when the long-suffering
of God waited in the days of Noah.</em> At this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
point we come upon a twofold line of interpretation,
occasioned by the difficulty which constantly arises of
deciding whether &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#957;&#945;&mdash;"spirit" is to be understood
of the Divine Spirit or of the spiritual part of man's
nature as distinguished from the flesh. Those who
have taken the words "quickened in the Spirit" of the
previous verse in the former of these senses explain this
passage of the preaching of Christ to the antediluvian
world through His servant Noah. The Divine fiat had
gone forth. The Flood was to come and bring destruction
to the bodies of all but Noah and his family. But
within those doomed bodies souls were shut up, and
these the love of Christ would not willingly give over.
They should hear, while still in their prison of the
flesh, the offer of His grace; and should they repent,
the waves which wrought destruction of the body
might release them from the bondage of corruption.
This was the purpose of God's long-suffering, which
waited and appealed while the ark was a-preparing.
Thus did the Divine Spirit of Christ go forth as a
herald of mercy to the impenitent, proclaiming that for
their souls the door of forgiveness was not yet closed.</p>

<p>Those, on the contrary, who refer "quickened in the
spirit" to the human soul of Christ, take this text as
an additional authority for the doctrine in the Apostles'
Creed that our Lord's human soul after the Crucifixion
descended into hell. Thus, they hold, His pure spirit
went beyond this world to experience all that human
spirits can know before the judgement comes. Thither
He came but as a Herald. Death and the grave had
no power to detain Him. In mercy to those who had
passed away before the Incarnation, He brought the
message of the mediatorial work which He had completed
in His crucifixion. The sinners before the Flood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
are singled out for mention by St. Peter as sinners
above all men, so sunk in wickedness that but eight
were found worthy to be saved from the Deluge. Thus
the magnitude of Christ's mercy is glorified. He who
goes to seek these must long to save all men. And
to carry this message of glad tidings is part of the
recompense for the agonies of Gethsemane and Calvary,
a portion of what made it a blessing to suffer for well-doing.</p>

<p>Up to the sixteenth century the latter exposition and
application of the words found most favour, but at
the time of the Reformation the chief authorities<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
expounded them of the preaching of Christ's Spirit
through the ministry of the patriarch. For the main
argument with which St. Peter is dealing these applications,
however interesting in themselves, are not deeply
important. He wants to set before the converts a
warrant for what he has said about the blessedness of
suffering for righteousness. If we accept the application
to Noah, the example is a powerful one. His
sufferings must have been manifold. The long time
between the threatened judgement and its accomplishment
was filled with the opposition of sinners and their
mockery and taunts over his patient labour on the ark,
to say nothing of the distress of soul when he found
his preaching falling ever on deaf ears. But his trial
had its reward at last when the little band were shut
in by God Himself, and the ark bore them safely on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the rising waters. And if he could feel that any,
though perishing in body, had by repentance been
saved in soul, this would make light the burden even
of greater suffering than had fallen to the patriarch,
to know the joy which comes from converting a sinner
from the error of his way and therein saving a soul
from death.</p>

<p>And if we refer the words "quickened in the spirit"
to the soul of Christ, parted from the body and present
in the spirit-world, they are a link to connect this
passage with words of the Apostle's sermon on the
day of Pentecost. There he does speak of the Lord's
descent into hell, and teaches how David of old spake
thereof and of the Resurrection "that neither was He
left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption"
(Acts ii. 31). In this sense the quickening in the
spirit is the beginning of Christ's victory and triumph.
It is the earnest of eternal life to all believers. And how
welcome a message to those who, like Abraham, had
rejoiced in faith to see the day of Christ, to hear from
His own lips the tidings of the victory won! Of the
Herald of such a Gospel message, of Him who by His
suffering delivered those who through fear of death
were all their lifetime subject to bondage, we may,
with all reverence, speak as "being made perfect by
becoming the Author of eternal salvation to all them
that obey Him" (Heb. v. 9).</p>

<p><em>Wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved.</em> The
building of the ark was the test of Noah's faith, the
ark itself the means of his preservation. In the patriarch's
sufferings St. Peter has found an apt parallel
to the life of these Asian Christians: the same godless
surroundings; the same opposition and mockery;
the same need for steadfast faith. But if rightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
pondered, the Old Testament lesson is rich in teaching.
Noah becomes a preacher of righteousness, not
for his own generation only, but for all time. He
suffered in his well-doing. Nothing stings more
keenly than scorn and contempt. These he experienced
to the full. He came as God's herald to men who
had put God out of all their thoughts. His message was
full of terror: "Behold, I do bring a flood of waters
upon the earth, to destroy all flesh wherein is the
breath of life from under heaven; everything that is
in the earth shall die" (Gen. vi. 17). Few heeded;
fewer still believed. But when the work of the messenger
was over; when the ark was prepared, and
the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and
the windows of heaven were opened; when he and his
were shut in by God, then appeared the blessedness.
And if haply there had been any in whom he had
beheld signs of repentance, how the thought that some
souls were saved, though their bodies were drowned
with the rest, would magnify the rejoicing of the rescued;
and the overthrow of the ungodly would proclaim how
little ultimate bliss there could be in evil-doing. All
these things would come home to the hearts of the
"strangers of the dispersion."</p>

<p>And were they few in number? Fewer still were
those who stood with Noah in the world's corruption.
But God was with him; he walked with God, and
found grace in His eyes; and God blessed him when
the Flood was gone, and by the sign of the covenant,
the faithful witness in heaven (Psalm lxxxix. 37), has
placed a memorial of the happiness of his well-doing
before the eyes of mankind for ever. And it would
comfort the believers if they kept in mind the object
which St. Peter has so often set before them, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
which he would have them set their desire in their
distress. There was hope, nay assurance, that the
heathen world around them would be won by their
steadfast well-doing to the service of the Lord. Christ
did not send his followers on a hopeless quest when
He said, "Go, baptize all nations." It was no material
ark they were set to fashion; they were exalted to be
builders of the Church of Christ. And to put one
stone upon another in that building was a joy worth
earning by a life of sacrifice.</p>

<p><em>Saved through water.</em> But God appointed the same
waves to be the destruction of the disobedient. With
no faith-built ark in which to ride safe, the sinners
perished in the mighty waters which to Noah were
the pathway of deliverance. A solemn thought this
for those who have the offer of the antitype which the
Apostle turns next to mention! This double use which
God makes of His creatures&mdash;how to some they bring
punishment, to others preservation&mdash;is the theme of
several noble chapters in the book of Wisdom (xi.-xvi.),
expanding the lesson taught by the pillar of a cloud,
which was light to Israel, while it was thick darkness
to the Egyptians.</p>

<p><em>Which also after a true likeness doth now save you,
even baptism.</em> Under the new covenant also water has
been chosen by Christ to be the symbol of His grace.
His servants are baptized into the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost. This is the door appointed for
entrance into the family. But the waters of the Flood
would have overwhelmed Noah, even as the rest, had
he not been within the ark, and the ark would not
have been made had he been lacking in faith. So
in baptism must no more saving office be ascribed
to the water. Even the Divine word, "the word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
hearing, did not profit some, because they were not
united by faith with them that heard aright" (Heb. iv. 2).
Neither does the sign in baptism, though Divinely
instituted, profit, being alone. The Christian, having
been cleansed by the washing of water with the word,
is sanctified by Christ because of his faith. The
washing of regeneration must be joined with the renewing
of the Holy Ghost. That Spirit does not renew,
but convicts of sin those who believe not on Christ
(John xvi. 8). In his salvation Noah accepted and
acted on God's warning about things not seen as yet,
and so his baptism became effectual. In faith, too,
Israel marched through the Red Sea, and beheld the
overthrow of their heathen pursuers. And baptism
mixed with faith is saving now. Those Old Testament
deliverances were figures only of the true, and were
but for temporal rescue. Christ's ordinance is that
to which they testified before His coming, and is coupled
with the promise of His presence even unto the end of
the world.</p>

<p>And that there may be no place for doubting, the
Apostle subjoins a twofold explanation. First he tells
us what baptism is not, then what it is and what
it bestows. It is <em>not the putting away of the filth of
the flesh</em>. Were this all, it would avail no more than
the cardinal ordinances (with meats and drinks and
divers washings) which were imposed of old until
a time of reformation. Through them the way into
the holy place was not made manifest, nor could be.
True baptism is <em>the interrogation of a good conscience
toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ</em>.
This is a spiritual purification, wrought through the
might of Christ's resurrection. And the Apostle
describes it by the effect which it produces in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
religious condition and attitude of him who has experienced
it. The sinner who loves his sin dare not
question his conscience. That witness would pronounce
for his condemnation. So he finds it best to lull it
to sleep, or perhaps deaden it altogether. But to him
who, being risen with Christ in faith, seeks those
things that are above, who strives to make himself
spiritually purer day by day, there is no such dread.
Rather by constant questioning and self-examination
he labours that his conscience may be void of offence
towards God and man. That man not only dares, but
knows it to be a most solemn duty, thus to purge his
conscience. So the effect of baptism is daily felt, and
the questioned soul thankfully bears witness to the active
presence of the Spirit, for the bestowal of which the
Sacrament was the primal pledge.</p>

<p>Others have rendered &#7952;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8061;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#945; "an appeal," and
have joined it very closely with the words <em>toward
God</em>. These have found in the Apostle's explanation
the recognition of that power to draw nigh unto God
which the purified conscience both feels, and feels
the need of. There are daily stumblings, the constant
want of help; and through Christ's resurrection the
way is opened, a new and living way, into the holiest,
and the power is granted of appealing unto God, while
the sense of baptismal grace already bestowed gives
confidence and certainty that our petitions will be
granted.</p>

<p><em>Who is on the right hand of God, having gone into
heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made
subject unto Him.</em> Now the Apostle turns back to his
main subject. The righteous who suffers for, and in,
his righteousness, may not only be a blessing to others,
but may himself find blessing. We dare only use the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
words which the Spirit has supplied when we speak of
Christ being perfected by what He endured. But the
Apostle to the Hebrews has a clear teaching. He
speaks of Christ as being "the effulgence of God's
glory, and the very image of His person" (Heb. i. 3).
Yet he tells that, "though He was a Son, He learned
obedience by the things which He suffered, and became
thus the Author of eternal salvation unto all them that
obey Him" (Heb. v. 8). And he goes further, and
teaches that this submission of Christ to suffering was
in harmony with the Divine character and according to
God's own purpose: "It became Him for whom are
all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing
many sons unto glory, to make the Author of their
salvation perfect through sufferings" (Heb. ii. 10). From
all eternity Christ was perfect as the Son of God, but
He has suffered that He may be a perfect Mediator.
Why this was well-pleasing unto the Father it is not
ours to know, nor can we by searching find. But, the
sufferings ended, He is crowned with glory; He is
exalted to the right hand of the Father; He is made
Lord of all. This He taught His disciples ere He sent
them to baptize: "All authority hath been given unto
Me in heaven and on earth" (Matt. xxviii. 18). Having
taken hold of the seed of Abraham and consented to
be made lower than the angels, He has now been set
"far above all principality, and power, and might, and
dominion, and every name that is named, not only in
this world, but also in that which is to come" (Eph. i. 21).
Thus does St. Paul teach even as St. Peter; and we
may believe, though we fail to grasp the manner thereof,
that through His humiliation our blessed Lord has
been exalted, not only because He receives for ever the
praises of the redeemed, but because He has wrought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
through His suffering that which was well-pleasing in
the sight of the Father.</p>

<p>The whole clause before us is worthy of notice for
another reason. It was doubtless written before our
Gospels were in circulation, when the life and work of
Jesus were only published by the oral teaching of the
Apostles and their fellows; yet in a summary form it
covers the whole field of the Gospel story. Those to
whom this Epistle was written had been taught that
Jesus was the Christ, had heard of His righteous life
among men, of His sufferings, death, and resurrection,
had been taught that afterwards He was taken up into
heaven. They knew also that the baptism by which
they had been admitted into the Christian communion
was His ordinance and the appointed door into the
Church which He lived and died to build up among
men. Thus, without the Gospels, we have the Gospel
in the Epistles, and a witness to the integrity of that
history of Christ's life which has come down to us in
the narratives of the Evangelists. And when all the
contributions of the Apostolic Epistles are put side by
side, we may easily gather from them that the history
of Jesus which we have now is that which the Church
has possessed from the beginning of the Gospel.</p>

<h3><em>THE LESSONS OF SUFFERING</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, arm ye yourselves
also with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath
ceased from sin; that ye no longer should live the rest of your time
in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. For the time
past may suffice to have wrought the desire of the Gentiles, and to
have walked in lasciviousness, lusts, winebibbings, revellings, carousings,
and abominable idolatries: wherein they think it strange that
ye run not with <em>them</em> into the same excess of riot, speaking evil of
<em>you</em>: who shall give account to Him that is ready to judge the quick
and the dead. For unto this end was the gospel preached even to
the dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh,
but live according to God in the spirit."&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> iv. 1-6.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is always hard to swim against the stream; and
if the effort be a moral one, the difficulty is not
lessened. These early Christians were finding it so.
For them there must have existed hardships of which
to-day we can have no experience, and form but an
imperfect estimate. If they lived among a Jewish
population, these were sure to be offended at the new
faith. And when we remember the zeal for persecution
of a Saul of Tarsus, we can see that in many
cases the better the Jew, the more would he feel himself
bound, if possible, to exterminate the new doctrines.
Among the heathen the lot of the Christians was often
worse. Did the people listen a while to the teaching
of the missionaries, yet so unstable were they that, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
at Lystra, to-day might see them stoning those whom
yesterday they were venerating as gods; and they
could easily, by reason of their greater numbers, bring
the magistrates to inflict penalties even where the
multitude refrained from mob violence. The cry,
"These men exceedingly trouble our city" or "These
who turn the world upside down are come among us,"
was sure to find a ready audience; while the uproar
and violence which raged in a city like Ephesus, when
Paul and his companions preached there, shows how
many temporal interests could be banded together
against the Christian cause. On individual believers,
not of the number of the preachers, the more violent
attacks might not fall; but to suffer in the flesh was
the lot of most of them in St. Peter's day. Hence the
strong figure he employs to describe the preparation
they will need: <em>Arm ye yourselves</em>&mdash;make you ready,
for you are going forth to battle. St. Paul also, writing
to Rome and Corinth, uses the same figure: "Let
us put on the armour of light," "the armour of
righteousness on the right hand and on the left."</p>

<p><em>Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, arm ye
yourselves also with the same mind.</em> Though some
strokes of the foe will fall on the flesh, the conflict is
really a spiritual one. The suffering in the body is
to be sustained and surmounted by an inward power;
the armour of light and of righteousness is the equipment
of the soul, which panoply the Apostle here calls
the mind of Christ. Now what is the mind of Christ
which can avail His struggling servants? The word
implies intention, purpose, resolution, that on which the
heart is set. Now the intention of Christ's life was to
oppose and overcome all that was evil, and to consecrate
Himself to all good for the love of His people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
This latter He tells us in His parting prayer for his
disciples: "For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that
they themselves also may be sanctified in truth"
(John xvii. 19), while every action of His life proclaims
His determined enmity against sin. This brought Him
obloquy while He lived in the world, and in the end
a shameful death; but these things did not abate His
hatred of sin, nor lessen His love for sinners. For still
into the city where He reigns there shall in no wise
enter anything that defileth (Rev. xxi. 27), though to the
faithful penitent "the Spirit and the bride say, Come,
and he that is athirst, let him come; he that will, let
him take the water of life freely" (Rev. xxii. 17).</p>

<p>Christ bare willingly all that was laid upon Him that
He might bring men unto God. This is the spirit,
this the purpose, the intent, with which His followers
are to be actuated: to have the same strenuous abhorrence
of sin, the same devotion in themselves to
goodness, which shall make them inflexible, however
fiercely they may be assailed. Let them only make
the resolve, and power shall be bestowed to strengthen
them. He who says, "Arm yourselves," supplies the
weapons when His servants need them. Jesus Himself
found them ready when the tempter came, and
drew them in all their keenness and strength from the
Divine armoury. Satan comes to others as he came
to Christ, and will make them flinch and waver, if
he can. At times he offers attractive baits; at times
he brings fear to his aid. But, in whatever shape he
comes or sends his agents, let them but cling to the
mind of Christ, and they shall, like Him, say triumphantly,
"Get thee behind me, Satan."</p>

<p><em>For he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from
sin.</em> God intends it to be so, and the earnest Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
strives with all his might that it may be so. To help
men God sends them sufferings, and intends them to
have a moral effect on the life. They are not penal;
they are the discipline of perfect love desiring that men
should be held back from straying. Men cannot always
see the purposes of God at first, and are prone to
bewail their lot. But here and there a saint of old
has left his testimony. One of the later psalmists had
discovered the blessedness of God-sent trials: "Before
I was afflicted I went astray; but now I observe
Thy word"; and, in thankful acknowledgment of
the love which sent the blows, he adds, "It is good
for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn
Thy statutes" (Psalm cxix. 67, 71). Hezekiah had
learnt the lesson, though it brought him close to the
gates of the grave; but he testifies, "Behold, it was
for my peace that I had great bitterness.... Thou
hast cast all my sins behind Thy back" (Isa. xxxviii. 17).
God had blotted out the evil record, that he who had
suffered in the flesh might cease from sin. It is good
for us thus to recognise that God's dispensations are
for our correction and teaching, and that without them
we should have been verily desolate, left to choose our
own way, which would surely have been evil; and
though we cannot cease from sin while we are in the
flesh, God's mercy places the ideal state before us&mdash;<em>He
that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin</em>&mdash;that
we may be strengthened, nevermore to submit
ourselves to the yoke of wickedness. How shall he
that is dead to sin live any longer therein? Live
therein he cannot. Of that old man within him he
will have no resurrection, for though the motions, the
promptings to evil, are there, the love of evil is slain
by the greater love of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p><em>That ye no longer should live the rest of your time in
the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</em>
Christians must live out their lives till God calls them,
and for the rest of their time in the flesh they will be
among their wonted surroundings. Just as Christian
slaves must abide with their masters, and Christian
wives continue with their husbands, so each several
believer must do his duty where God has placed him.
But because he is a believer it will be done in a
different spirit. He is daily cutting himself away from
what the world counts for life; he has begun to live
in the Spirit, and the natural man is weakened day by
day; he knows that what is born of the flesh is flesh,
and bears the taint of sin: so he refuses to follow
where it would lead him. Men often plead for evil
habits that they are natural, forgetting that "natural"
thus used means human, corrupt nature. The birth
of the Spirit transforms this nature, and the renewed
man goes about his worldly life with a new motive,
new purposes. He must follow his lawful calling like
other folks, but the sense of his pilgrimage makes
him to differ; he is longing to depart, and holds
himself in constant readiness. Worldly men live as
though they were rooted here and would never be
moved. "Their inward thought is that their houses
shall continue for ever, and their dwelling-places to all
generations; they call their lands after their own
names" (Psalm xlix. 11). To the servant of Christ life
wears another aspect. He is content to live on, for
God so wills it, and has work for him to do. To
continue in the flesh may be, as it was to St. Paul, the
fruit of his labour. And he welcomes this owning of
his work, and will spend his powers in like service.
Yet, with the Apostle, he has ever "the desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
depart and be with Christ, for it is very far better"
(Phil. i. 23).</p>

<p>And as he strives to fulfil God's intent by crucifying
the old man and ceasing from sin, the Christian rejoices
in a growing sense of freedom. To follow the lusts of
men was to serve many and hard taskmasters. Riches,
fame, luxury, sensual indulgences, riotous living, are all
keen to win new slaves, and paint their lures in the
most attractive colours; and one appetite will make
itself the ally of another, lust hard by greed, so that
the chains of him who takes service with them are
riveted many times over, and difficult, often impossible,
to be cast off. But the will of God is one: "One is
your Master"; "Love the Lord your God with all your
heart"; "And all ye are brethren"; "Love your neighbour
as yourself." Then shall you enter into life. And
the life of this promise is not that fragment of time
which remains to men in the flesh, but that unending
after-life where the natural body shall be exchanged
for a spiritual body, and death be swallowed up in
victory.</p>

<p><em>For the time past may suffice to have wrought the desire
of the Gentiles.</em> The Apostle here seems to be addressing
the Jews who, living among the Gentiles, had, like their
forefathers in Canaan, learned their works. The nation
was not so prone to fall away into heathendom after
the Captivity; yet some of them in the dispersion, like
Samson when he went down unto the Philistines, may
have been captured and blinded and made to serve.
The proximity of evil is infectious. To the Gentile
converts St. Peter speaks elsewhere as having been
slaves to their lusts in ignorance (i. 14). But whether
Jew or Gentile, when they had once tasted the joy of
this purer service, this law of obedience which made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
them truly free, they would be strengthened to suffer
in the flesh rather than fall back upon their former life.
The time would seem enough, far more than enough,
to have been thus defiled. All was God's; all that
remained must be given to Him with strenuous
devotion.</p>

<p>St. Peter seems to place in contrast, as he describes
the two ways of life, two words, one by which he
denotes the service of God, by the other devotion to the
world and its attractions. The former (&#952;&#8051;&#955;&#951;&#956;&#945;) implies
a pleasure and joy; it is the will of God, that which He
delights in, and which He makes to be a joy to those
who serve Him. The other (&#946;&#959;&#8059;&#955;&#951;&#956;&#945;) has a sense of
longing, unsatisfied want, a state which craves for
something which it cannot attain. St. Paul describes
it as "led away by divers lusts, ever learning" (but
in an evil school), "never able to come to the knowledge
of the truth, corrupted in mind, reprobate"
(2 Tim. iii. 7). Such is the desire of the Gentiles. The
Apostle describes it in his next words: <em>To have walked
in lasciviousness, lusts, winebibbings, revellings, carousings,
and abominable idolatries</em>. How gross heathendom
can be our missionaries from time to time reveal to us.
All the corruptions which they describe were reigning
in full power round about these converts. When men
change the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness
of corruptible man or even worse, and worship
and serve the creature, their own animal passions,
rather than the Creator, there is no depth of degradation
to which they may not sink. St. Paul has painted
for us some dark pictures of what such lives could be
(Rom. i. 24-32; Col. iii. 5-8). But though Christianity
in our own land have forced sin to veil some of its
fouler aspects, vice has not changed its nature. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
same passions rule in the hearts of those who live to
the lusts of men, and not to the will of God. The flesh
warreth against the Spirit, even if the Spirit be not
utterly quenched, and brings men into its slavery. For
the sake of Christ, then, and for love of the brethren, the
faithful have need still to be proclaiming, <em>Let the time
past suffice</em>, and by their actions to testify that they
are willing to suffer in the flesh, if so be they may
thereby be sustained in the battle against sin and may
strengthen their brethren to walk in a new way.</p>

<p><em>Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them
into the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you.</em> The
godless love to be a large company, that they may keep
one another in heart. Hence they who have been of
them, and would fain withdraw, have no easy task;
and to win new comrades sinners are ever most
solicitous. Their invitations at first will take a friendly
tone. Solomon understood them well, and described
them in warning to his son: "Come with us," they say:
"let us lay wait for blood; let us lurk privily for the
innocent without cause; let us swallow them up alive
as Sheol, and whole as those that go down into the pit.
We shall find all precious substance; we shall fill our
houses with spoil. Thou shalt cast thy lot among us;
we will all have one purse" (Prov. i. 11-14). This
is one fashion of their excess of riot, but there are
many more. The Apostle's words picture their life as
an overflow, a deluge. And the figure is not strange
in Holy Writ. "The floods of ungodly men made me
afraid," says the Psalmist (Psalm xviii. 14); and St.
Jude, writing about the same time as St. Peter and of
the same evil days, calls such sinners "wild waves
of the sea, foaming out their own shames" (Jude 14).
"Shames," he says, because the floods of excess pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
on in overwhelming abundance, and those who escape
from them do so only with much suffering in the flesh,
sent of God, to set them free from sin.</p>

<p>And if there be no hope of winning recruits or
alluring back those who have escaped, the godless
follow another course. They hate, and persecute, and
malign. Ever since the days of Cain this has been the
policy of the wicked, though not all push it so far as
did the first murderer (1 John iii. 12). For the life of
the righteous is a constant reproach to them. They
have made their own choice, but it yields them no
comfort; and if one means of making others as
wretched as themselves fails, they take another. They
point the finger of hatred and scorn at the faithful.
To the Greeks Christ's faith was foolishness. The
Athenians, full of this world's wisdom, asked about
Paul, "What will this babbler say?" and mocked as
they heard of the resurrection of the dead. With them
and such as they this life is all. But the Christian
has his consolation: he has committed his cause to
another Judge, before whom they also who speak evil
of him must appear.</p>

<p><em>Who shall give account to Him that is ready to judge
the quick and the dead.</em> The Christian looks on to
the coming judgement. He can therefore disregard the
censures of men. Neither the penalties nor the
revilings of the world trouble him. They are a part of
the judgement in the present life; by them God is
chastening him, preparing him by the suffering in the
flesh to be more ready for the coming of the Lord. In
that day it will be seen how the servant has been made
like unto his Master, how he has welcomed the purging
which Christ gives to His servants that they may bring
forth more fruit. He believes, yea knows, that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Judge who has been teaching and judging him here
day by day he will find a Mediator and a Saviour.
With the unbeliever all is otherwise. He has refused
correction, has chosen his own path, and drawn away
his neck from the yoke of Christ; his judgment is all
yet to come. The Judge is ready, but He is full of
mercy. St. Peter's phrase implies this. It tells of
readiness, but also of holding back, of a desire to spare.
He is on His throne, the record is prepared, but yet
He waits; He is Himself the long-suffering Vinedresser
who pleads, "Let it alone this year also."</p>

<p>Such has been the mercy of God even from the days
of Eden. In the first temptation Eve adds one sin
upon another. First she listens to the insidious questioning
which proclaims the speaker a foe to God:
then without remonstrance she hears God's truth
declared a lie; hearkens to an aspersion of the Divine
goodness; then yields to the tempter, sins, and leads
her husband into sin. Not till then does God's judgement
fall, which might have fallen at the first offence;
and when it is pronounced, it is full of pity, and gives
more space for repentance. So, though the Judge be
ready, His mercy waits. For He will judge the dead
as well as the living, and while men live His compassion
goes forth in its fulness to the ignorant and them
that are out of the way.</p>

<p><em>For unto this end was the gospel preached even to the
dead, that they might be judged according to men in the
flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</em> "<em>Unto this
end</em>"&mdash;what does it signify? What but that God has
ever been true to the name under which He first
revealed Himself: "The Lord God, merciful and
gracious" (Exod. xxxiv. 6); that He has been preaching
the Gospel to sinners by His dispensations from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the first day until now? Thus was the Gospel preached
unto Abraham (Gal. iii. 8) when he was called from
the home of his fathers, and pointed forward through
a life of trial to a world-wide blessing. Heeding the
lesson, he was gladdened by the knowledge of the day
of Christ. In like manner and unto this end was
the Gospel sent to God's people in the wilderness
(Heb. iv. 2), even as unto us; but the word of hearing
did not profit them. With many of them God was
not well pleased. Yet He showed them in signs His
Gospel sacraments. They were all baptized unto Moses
in the cloud and in the sea, did all eat the same
spiritual meat, and all drank the same spiritual drink
(1 Cor. x. 2-4), for Christ was with them, as their Rock
of refreshing, all their journey through the desert,
preaching the Gospel by visitations now of mercy, now
of affliction. Unto this end He brought them many a
time under the yoke of their enemies; unto this end
He sent them into captivity. Thus were they being
judged, as men count judgements, if haply they might
listen in this life to the gospel of trial and pain, and so
live at last, as God counts life, in the spirit, when the
final judgement-day is over. They are dead, but to
every generation of them was the Gospel preached,
that God might gather Him a great multitude to stand
on His right hand in the day of account.</p>

<p>Some have applied the words of this verse to the
sinners of the days of Noah, connecting them closely
with iii. 19; and truly, though they be but one
example out of a world of mercies, they are very
notable. They were doomed; they were dead while
they lived: "Everything that is in the earth shall
die" (Gen. vi. 17). Yet to them the preacher was
sent, and unto this end: that though they were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
drowned in the Deluge, and so in men's sight be
judged, their souls might be saved, as God would have
them saved, in the great day of the Lord. But every
visitation is a gospel, a gospel unto this end: that
through judgement here a people may be made ready in
God's sight to be called unto His rest.</p>

<p>Few passages have more powerful lessons than this
for every age. The world is full of suffering in the
flesh. Who has not known it in many kinds? But it
is in consequence, to those who will hear, very full
of Gospel sermons. They cry aloud, Sin no more;
the time past may suffice to have wrought the will of
the Gentiles. Suffering does not mean that God is not
full of love; rather it is a token that, in His great love,
He is training us, opening our eyes to our wrong-doings
that we may cast them off, and giving us a true
standard to judge between the desire of the Gentiles
and the will of God. And though men may look on us
as sore afflicted, our Father, when the rest of our time
in the flesh shall be ended, will give us the true life
with Him in the spirit.</p>

<h3><em>CHRISTIAN SERVICE FOR GOD'S GLORY</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore of sound
mind, and be sober unto prayer: above all things being fervent in
your love among yourselves; for love covereth a multitude of sins:
using hospitality one to another without murmuring: according as
each hath received a gift, ministering it among yourselves, as good
stewards of the manifold grace of God; if any man speaketh, <em>speaking</em>
as it were oracles of God; if any man ministereth, <em>ministering</em>
as of the strength which God supplieth: that in all things God may
be glorified through Jesus Christ, whose is the glory and the dominion
for ever and ever. Amen."&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> iv. 7-11.</p></blockquote>


<p><em>But the end of all things is at hand.</em> Well-nigh two
thousand years have passed away since the
Apostle wrote these words. What are we to think
of the teaching they convey? For it is not St. Peter's
teaching only. Those who laboured with him were
all of the same mind; all gave the same note of warning
to their converts. St. Paul exhorts the Philippians,
"Let your moderation be known unto all men. The
Lord is at hand" (Phil. iv. 5); and in the first letter to
the Corinthians the last words before his benediction
are to the same purport: "Maran atha" (1 Cor. xvi. 22);
that is, The Lord cometh. St. James preaches,
"Stablish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord
draweth nigh" (James v. 8). To the Hebrews the
Apostle writes, "Yet a little while, and He that shall
come will come, and will not tarry" (Heb. x. 37).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
While St. John, who lived longer than any of the rest,
conveys the warning even in more solemn tones:
"Little children, it is the last hour" (1 John ii. 18).
Are we to look on these admonitions as so many mistaken
utterances? Are we to think that the disciples
had misunderstood the Lord's teaching, or would they
say the same words if they were with us to-day?</p>

<p>We may allow that those who had been present at
the Ascension, and had heard the words of the angels
declaring that "this same Jesus should so come as
they had seen Him go into heaven" (Acts i. 11), might
expect His return to judge the world to be not far
distant. But, in whatever they say in reference thereto,
their main concern is that men should be ready. "In
such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh,"
is the ground-text of all their exhortations. Now
had arrived the fulness of the time (Gal. iv. 4) in
which God had sent forth His Son, born of a woman;
and if we take the verb of St. Peter's sentence
&#7972;&#947;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#949;, "has come near", we feel that he viewed the
new era on which the world had entered in this light.
And so did the other Apostles. One says, "Now once
in the end of the ages hath Christ been manifested"
(Heb. ix. 26); another teaches that things of old
"were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends
of the ages are come" (1 Cor. x. 11). God has
spoken aforetime in many portions and in many ways,
but in the end of these days He hath spoken in His
Son (Heb. i. 2). All things are now summed up in
Christ; He is the end of all things. Prophecy, type,
sacrifice, all have passed away. There will come no
new revelation; no word more will be added to the
Divine book. Its lessons will find in each generation
new illustrations, new applications, but will admit no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
change of form or substance. The Christian dispensation,
be it long or short, is the last time; it will close
with the Second Advent. And continual preparedness
is to be the Christian's attitude. And this is the
purport of St. Peter's next exhortations, which are as
forceful to-day as they were eighteen hundred years
ago.</p>

<p><em>Be ye therefore of sound mind.</em> Exactly the counsel
which should follow the previous lesson. It was
misinterpreted at first, as it has been since. We know
how unwisely the Thessalonians behaved when they
had been told by St. Paul, "The day of the Lord so
cometh as a thief in the night" (1 Thess. v. 2). The
Apostle learnt that they were sorely disturbed, and
wrote them a second letter, from which we can gather
how far they had wandered from soundness of mind.
At first the Apostle speaks gently: "Be not quickly
shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either
by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that
the day of the Lord is now present" (2 Thess. ii. 2).
But soon he shows us how the excitement had operated.
Some among them had begun to walk disorderly,
apparently thinking that they might live upon the
community, working not at all, but being busybodies.
These made, no doubt, the approach of the day of the
Lord their pretext. St. Paul bids such men in quietness
to work and eat their own bread. To be found
at their duty was the best way of preparing for the
end.</p>

<p>How soundness of mind may serve the Church of
Christ is seen in the settlement of that murmuring
which arose (Acts vi. 1) as soon as the Christian
disciples began to be multiplied in Jerusalem. It was
the Grecian Jews who complained that their widows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
were neglected. The Apostles wisely withdrew from
the distribution about which the complaint was made,
and more wisely still gave the oversight into the hands
of Greeks (as the forms of all their names bear witness)
who would be fully trusted by the murmurers. "And
the word of God increased." The pages of Church
history supply examples in abundance of the need in
religious matters for this soundness of mind. We
need not go back to very ancient times. What sore
evils led to and arose out of the peasant war in
Germany in the days of the Reformation, followed
by those excesses which disgraced the name of
Christianity in Münster and other parts of Westphalia!
And in our own land both at that time and subsequently
the unwise enthusiasm of those who acted as
though whatever had been must be wrong hindered
sorely the temperate efforts of the more conservative
and sober minds; while undue prominence given to
single doctrines of the Gospel has many times warped
men's minds; and does so still, making the cause of
Christ to be hardly spoken of. A sense of proportion
is a gift which the Church may fitly pray for in her
members, and that, while they seek to foster the sevenfold
graces of the Holy Spirit, they may ever keep in
mind the mercy of Him who bestows only a portion on
each of us as we can receive it, and makes no man the
steward of them all.</p>

<p><em>And be sober unto prayer.</em> The Apostle selects one
example wherein the sound mind ought to be sought
after, and he has chosen it so as to be of general
application. The wisdom to which he is exhorting
is needed for all men, both those who teach and those
who hear, those who serve tables and those who are
served thereby. Many members of the Christian body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
however, will not be concerned with such special duties.
But all will pray, and so to prayer he applies his precept.
<em>Be sober.</em> A sound mind will preserve us from
extravagance in our approach unto God. For even
here extravagance may intrude. The Corinthian Church
had gone very far wrong in this respect. Over-elated,
losing soundness of mind, through the bestowal of
certain gifts, they had introduced such irregularities
into their religious meetings that St. Paul speaks of
occasions when they might have been regarded as
madmen (1 Cor. xiv. 23). These were public prayers.
St. James applies the same standard to private prayers:
"Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss"
(James iv. 3). There is no true prayer in your petitions.
You have selected in your own hearts what you would
fain have and do, and you come before God with these
as your supplications. There is no thought in them
of yielding to God's will, but only the sense that if
your petitions were granted you would reap a present
satisfaction. Ye ask amiss. Many a heart can testify
to the proneness to err thus by want of sobriety.</p>

<p><em>Above all things being fervent in your love among
yourselves.</em> Soundness of mind and sobriety should
dominate every part of the believer's life; but there
are other virtues of pre-eminent excellence, unto
which, though they be far above him, he is encouraged
to aspire. Of these St. Peter, like St. Paul (1 Cor.
xiii. 13), places love at the summit, above all things.
The word he uses signifies that perfect love which is
the attribute of God Himself. To frail humanity it
must ever be an ideal. But the Apostle in his second
epistle (2 Peter i. 7) has given a progressive list of
graces to be sought after in a holy life, a series of
mountain summits each above the other, and each made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
visible through the one below it. Here, too, love comes
as the climax; and the Revised Version marks it as far
above mere human affection: "In your love of the
brethren supply also love." Here is no anticlimax, if
we once appreciate the grandeur of the concluding
term.</p>

<p>In the present verse, however, the Apostle exhorts
that this Divine quality is to be exercised by the converts
among themselves, and exercised with much
earnestness and diligence. It is to be the grace which
pervades all their lives, and extends itself to every
condition thereof. But we understand why St. Peter
has used this word for love as soon as we come to
the clause which follows: <em>For love covereth a multitude
of sins</em>. To cover sin is Godlike. It has been often
asked, Whose sins are covered by this love, those of
him who loves, or of him who is loved? The question
can have but one answer. There is nothing in the
New Testament to warrant such a doctrine as that
love towards one's fellow-men will hide, atone for, or
cancel any man's sins. When our Lord says of the
woman who was a sinner, "Her sins, which are many,
are forgiven; for she loved much" (Luke vii. 47), it is
not love to the brethren of which He is speaking, but
love to God, which she had manifested by her actions
toward Himself; and when He presently adds, "Thy
faith hath saved thee," He tells us the secret of her
availing love. But when men are animated by that
love toward their neighbours which shows likest
God's, they are tender to their offences; they look to
the future more than to the past, hoping all things,
believing all things; they have tasted God's mercy in
the pardon of their own sins, and labour to do thus
unto others, to cast their sins out of sight, to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
them, as God does when He forgives, behind their back,
as though in being forgiven they were also forgotten.
The phrase is quoted by St. Peter from Prov. x. 12,
where Solomon says, "Love covereth <em>all</em> sins," and our
Lord's words to St. Peter himself (Matt. xviii. 22)
about forgiving until seventy times seven times practically
set no limit to the extension of pardon to the
repentant. Thus taught, the Apostle uses the noble
word &#7936;&#947;&#8049;&#960;&#951; of human tenderness to offenders, because
he would urge men to a boundless, all-embracing,
Godlike pity for sinners.</p>

<p><em>Using hospitality one to another without murmuring.</em>
We need only reflect on the narrative of the Acts of
the Apostles to realise how large a part hospitality
must have played in the early Church as soon as the
preachers extended their labours beyond Jerusalem.
The house of Simon the tanner, where Peter was entertained
many days (ix. 43); the friends who at
Antioch received Paul and Barnabas and kept them
for a whole year (xi. 26); the petition of Lydia, "Come
into my house, and abide there" (xvi. 15); and Jason's
reception of Paul and Silas at Thessalonica (xvii. 7),
are but illustrations of what must have been the
general custom. Nor would such welcome be needed
for the Apostles alone. The Churches must have been
very familiar with cases of brethren driven from their
own country by persecution, or severed from their
own kinsfolk by the adoption of the new faith. To
such the kind offices of the Christian congregations
must have been constantly extended, so that hospitality
was consecrated into a blessed and righteous duty.
To be "given to hospitality" (Rom. xii. 13) is reckoned
among the marks whereby it shall be known that
believers, being many, are one body in Christ; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
from the salutations in the last chapter of the Epistle
to the Romans we can frame a picture of the large
work of lodging and caring for strangers as it entered
into the duties of a Christian life. The brethren at
Rome are exhorted to receive and help Ph&oelig;be, the
bringer of the Epistle, because she had been a succourer
of many, and of Paul himself. Of Priscilla and Aquila,
who are next named, we know that they were friends
and fellow-workers with St. Paul in Corinth, and that
in Ephesus they showed their Christian love toward the
stranger Apollos; and not only so, but they provided
a place where the brethren might assemble for their
worship. Later on is mentioned Mary, who bestowed
much labour on the brethren, Urbanus, a helper in
Christ, and the households of Aristobulus and Narcissus,
whole families made friends through the extension
of hospitality. Of the mother of Rufus St. Paul speaks
tenderly as his own mother also. The coupling together
of Philologus and Julia suggests that they were
husband and wife and had opened their doors to the
brethren, and the notice of Nereus and his sister points
to similar good offices. And from whatever place the
Epistle was sent to Rome, there Tertius, St. Paul's
amanuensis, was under the hospitable roof of Gaius,
whom he speaks of as the host of the whole Church.
Doubtless at times the burden might fall heavily on some
of the poorer brethren. Hence the need for the Apostle's
addition <em>without murmuring</em>. The word is the same
which is used (Acts vi. 1) of the complaints of the
Grecians. And in this matter, as in all, a sound mind
would be called for, that loads might be placed by the
Churches only on such as were able to bear them.</p>

<p>The intimate fellowship that would grow out of such
exercise of kind offices must have been a power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
encourage greatly the labourers for Christ. As they
dwelt together, hours not given to public ministrations
would be spent in private converse, and would knit the
members together, and forward the common work.
As St. Paul writes to Philemon, who appears to have
been eminent in good offices, the hearts of the saints
were refreshed by this godly intercourse. In friendly
communion the love of all would wax warmer, zeal
become more earnest, the weak would be strengthened,
and the strong grow stronger.</p>

<p><em>According as each hath received a gift, ministering
it among yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold
grace of God.</em> The close connexion between <em>gifts</em> and
<em>grace</em> is better marked in the Greek than it can be in
the English. The &#967;&#945;&#961;&#8055;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; are bestowed upon us
by the &#967;&#8049;&#961;&#953;&#962; of God. But every word in the sentence
is full of force. Each hath received a gift. None can
plead his lack of faculty; none can claim exemption
from the duty of ministering; none is so poor but he has
something that he can lay out for the brethren. All
have time; all have kind words: the least can give, what
is the best of gifts, a good example. But what we have
is not our own; it is received: and humility would teach
us to believe that God has bestowed on us the powers
which we are best fitted, by place and opportunities, to
use in His service. None can say of any gift, "It is
all my own; I may do with it as I please." God
has set the world about us full of His exchangers.
The poor, the feeble, the doubting, the fearful&mdash;these
are God's bankers, with whom we may put out our
gifts to usury. And Himself is the security for all that
we deposit thus: "Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of
the least of these My brethren, ye did it unto Me."
Hence we live under the responsibility of stewardship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
And every man's gift is given to profit withal (&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#966;&#8051;&#961;&#959;&#957;, 1 Cor. xii. 7). The Greek implies that it
must be shared with others. Nor can any of us make
it a profit to himself till he have found the way to
make it profitable to his brethren.</p>

<p>That he may give more precision to his counsel, the
Apostle proceeds to speak of gifts under two heads into
which they are naturally divided. First come those
which St. Paul (Rom. xii. 6-8) ranges under the head
of prophecy, embracing therein teaching and exhortation
likewise: <em>If any man speaketh, speaking as it were
oracles of God</em>. The first Christian preachers must
have gained their knowledge of the life and teaching
of Jesus by listening to the narratives of the twelve,
and must have gone forth to give their teaching orally.
The training of those who were appointed to minister
in the various places whither the apostolic missions
penetrated must have been of the same kind. In those
first years there was work to be done which would
seem more important than the writing of a Gospel
history. When such preachers published to the congregations
what they had learnt of the Master's
lessons, their sermons would be orally given, and
though conveying the same instruction, would be liable
to constant modifications of words. It was from such
oral teaching that the variations found in the Gospel
narratives probably had their origin. The preachers
gave the spirit, and as nearly as possible the text, of
what they had been taught. Perhaps by memoranda
or otherwise, they would refresh their knowledge of
the apostolic words, so as to adhere as much as
might be to what they had first received. The word
&#955;&#8057;&#947;&#953;&#945;&mdash;oracles&mdash;which the Apostle here employs, seems
intended to remind such preachers and teachers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
they now, as the Jews of old, had received "living
oracles" (Acts vii. 38), words by which spiritual life
was conveyed, to deliver to the Church. Those of them
who were Jews would call to mind how God's prophets
had constantly prefaced their message with "Thus
saith the Lord" or concluded it with the Divine accrediting,
"I am the Lord"; and that the Christian prophet
must bear in mind that he is only an ambassador, and
must abide by his commission, if he would speak with
authority, that as a steward he must ever think of the
account to be some day given of the "oracles of God"
(Rom. iii. 2) with which he was entrusted, and must
"handle aright the word of truth" (2 Tim. ii. 15).
For all such is St. Peter's admonition, <em>If any man
speaketh, speaking as it were oracles of God</em>.</p>

<p>And next he turns to those gifts which are to be exercised
in deeds, and not in words: <em>If any man ministereth,
ministering as of the strength which God supplieth</em>.
Under "ministry" St. Paul classes (Rom. xii. 7, 8) giving,
ruling, showing mercy. These are duties which secure
the temporal condition of the Church and her members.
The New Testament story suggests many offices which
could be discharged by those who had not devoted
themselves in a special manner to the ministry of the
word. How much service would be called for by
those collections for the saints which St. Paul urges
so frequently upon the Churches! How many houses
would find employment in such labours as were exhibited
in the home of Dorcas! How many a traveller,
bent on his secular work, would carry apostolic
messages or letters to the flocks of the dispersion!
To these may be added those offices of mercy which
St. James describes as &#952;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#945;, outward acts of religion,
to visit the widows and fatherless in their affliction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
The strength which God supplieth embraces every
faculty or possession, be it wealth, administrative skill,
or special knowledge. The physician and the craftsman
alike may spend their powers for Christ. All may
be consecrated, ministered, as supplied of God. And it
is a gain to the Church when, following the apostolic
pattern, these duties of external religion are severed
from the prophecy, the spiritual work of the teacher.</p>

<p><em>That in all things God may be glorified through Jesus
Christ, whose is the glory and the dominion for ever and
ever. Amen.</em> This is to be the thought which animates
all who minister: that each man's service may be so
rendered to his brethren that it will work for the glory
of God. And Christ has led the way. He testifies
in His final prayer, "I glorified Thee on the earth,
having accomplished the work which Thou hast given
Me to do" (John xvii. 4). Of our work we can use
no such words. We are but unprofitable servants.
In many things we offend all. But all may labour in
the Christlike spirit; and thus through Him, through
service rendered in His name and for His sake, will
God be glorified. The thought of Jesus humbling
Himself, taking the form of a servant, testifying of
Himself, "The Son of man came not to be ministered
unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom
for many," can give a dignity to lowliest labour, and
at the same time can impart consolation to the true
labourers, for whom this mighty ransom has been paid,
their inheritance won, their salvation achieved; while
the Conqueror of sin and death, their Redeemer, has
taken His seat at God's right hand, where worshipping
spirits ever praise Him, saying, "Worthy art Thou, our
Lord and our God, to receive the glory, and the honour,
and the power" (Rev. iv. 11).</p>

<h3><em>THE BELIEVER'S DOUBLE JOY</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among
you, which cometh upon you to prove you, as though a strange thing
happened unto you: but insomuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of His glory also ye may
rejoice with exceeding joy. If ye are reproached for the name of
Christ, blessed <em>are ye</em>; because the <em>Spirit</em> of glory and the Spirit of
God resteth upon you."&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> iv. 12-14.</p></blockquote>


<p>After the benediction in ver. 11, we might have
supposed that the exhortations of the Apostle
were ended. But he now proceeds to make general
application of the lessons which above (ii. 19) he had
confined to a particular class: the Christians who were
in slavery. And the times appear to have called for
consolation. The Churches were in great tribulation.
St. Peter speaks here, more than in any other passage
of the Epistle, as if persecution were afflicting the
whole Christian body: <em>Beloved</em>&mdash;the word embraces
them all&mdash;<em>think it not strange concerning the fiery trial
among you, ... as though a strange thing happened
unto you</em>. His strong word implies extreme suffering.
St. John uses it (Rev. xviii. 9, 18) of the burning
up of the mystical Babylon, and it is found nowhere
else in the New Testament. A trial meriting this
description was harassing the Asian Christians; but
spite of the intensity of suffering, which may be inferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
from his language; he bids the converts not to
wonder at it or deem it other than their proper lot:
"Think it not strange."</p>

<p>He does not enter upon reasons for his admonition,
or he might have selected a goodly list of Old Testament
saints who for their faith were called to suffer.
For the Jewish brethren, Joseph and David, Elijah
and Micaiah, David and his companions in exile, Job
and Nehemiah, would have been forcible examples of
suffering for righteousness. The Apostle, however
selects only the loftiest instance. Christ, the Master
whom they were pledged to serve, had suffered, and
had said, besides, that all who would follow Him must
take up the cross. Need they wonder, then, if in their
case they found the Lord's teaching coming true?</p>

<p>But, in describing the purpose of their trials, the
Apostle introduces some words which place their
affliction in a distinct light: <em>Which cometh upon you to
prove you</em>&mdash;literally, for your proving (&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#957;
&#8017;&#956;&#8054;&#957;). And the word is that which is constantly used
of <em>temptation</em>, whether sent of God or coming in some
other way. When viewed as a process of proving,
the believers would be able to find some contentment
under their persecutions. God was putting them to
the test. He would know if they are in earnest in His
service, and so they are cast into the furnace, God's
wonted discipline. The prophet Zechariah tells both
of the process, and the God-intended result: "I will
refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as
gold is tried; they shall call on My name, and I will
hear them: I will say, It is My people; and they shall
say, The Lord is my God" (Zech. xii. 9). And the
Psalmist bears like testimony: "The Lord trieth the
righteous" (Psalm xi. 5), and says that for those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
found faithful the end is blessedness: "We went through
fire and through water, but Thou broughtest us out
into a wealthy place" (Psalm lxvi. 12).</p>

<p>Such thoughts would yield comfort to those for
whom St. Peter immediately wrote. They were suffering
for Christ's sake; their faith in Him was being
tested. But the Apostle's words are left for the
edification of all generations of believers. Throughout
all time and everywhere there has been abundance of
grief and pain. How may sufferers to-day participate
in the apostolic consolation? How may they learn
to think it not strange that they are afflicted?</p>

<p>The Apostle's words supply the answer to such
questions. And they are no light or infrequent questionings
both for ourselves and others. Men are prone
to lament over temporal losses or bodily sufferings,
their own or others', in tones which convey the idea
that such trials will in the end be compensated and
made efficacious for the future blessing of the sufferer.
The New Testament has no such doctrine. "The
trial which cometh upon you to prove you," is St.
Peter's expression. There is much suffering in the
world which is in no sense a participation of the
sufferings of Christ, in no sense a God-sent trial for
proving the faith of the sufferer.</p>

<p>Here, if honestly questioned, the individual conscience
will give the true answer; and if that inward witness
condemn the life for no excesses, of which suffering
is the appointed fruit, if the bodily pains be not the
outcome of a life lived to the flesh, nor the sorrow and
poverty the result of follies and extravagance aforetime,
then, with the anguish and distress which God hath
sent (for we may then count them as of His sending),
the Spirit will have bestowed light that we may discern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
their purpose, light which will show us God's hand
weaning us from the world and making us ready for
going home, or, it may be, giving to others through us
His teaching in message and example. Then the
enlightened and pacified soul will be able to rejoice
amid pain, conscious of purification; and will out of
the midst of sorrow see God's designs justified. Satan
will look on such times as his opportunity, and suggest
to the Christian that he is unduly afflicted and forgotten
of God; but the joy which comes from being
able to look trouble in the face, as sent by a Father,
drives away despondency and puts the enemy to rout.
He is triumphant who can rest on a faithful God, with
an assurance that with the temptation He will also
make the way of escape, that he may be able to endure
it (1 Cor. x. 13).</p>

<p>But dare we then pray, as Christ has taught us, "Lead
us not into temptation"? Yes, if we ponder rightly
on the purport of our petition. Christ does not bid
us pray to God not to try us; He Himself made no
such prayer for His disciples; He was Himself submitted
to such trial: "It pleased the Lord to bruise
Him; He hath put Him to grief" (Isa. liii. 10). Nay,
one Evangelist (Mark i. 12) tells us how He was not
led, but <em>driven</em> forth, of the Spirit into the wilderness
to be tempted of the devil. Yet He taught the prayer
to His disciples, and He did so because He knew both
what was in man, and what was in the world. In the
latter since sin entered, the tempter has found manifold
enticements to lead men astray. All that belongs to
the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, or the pride
of life, riches, influence, beauty, popularity, prosperity
of every kind, may be used as tests of faith, may be
made to glorify God; but they can also be perverted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
in the using. And there dwell within man strong
desires, which he is prompted to gratify at times,
without heeding whether their gratification be right or
wrong; and when desire and opportunity meet, there
is peril to the tempted.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds</div>
<div class="line">Makes deeds ill done!"</div>
</div></div>

<p>And when desire has once gained the mastery, the
next yielding is sooner made; the forbidden path
becomes the constant walk; the moral principle&mdash;the
Godlike in the conscience&mdash;is neglected; men grow
weaker, are led away of their own lusts and enticed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the unlawful desire be resisted
from the first, each succeeding conflict will offer less
hardship, each new victory be more easily gained, and
the virtuous act will become a holy habit; the man
will walk with God. For this end God uses the evil,
of which Satan is the father, to be a discipline, and
turns the snares of the enemy into a means of strength
for those whom he would captivate. Knowing all this,
Christ has left us His prayer. In it He would teach
us to ask that God should protect us in such wise that
the desire to sin which dwells within us may not be
roused to activity by opportunities of indulgence, or
if we are thrown where such opportunities exist, the
desire may be killed in our hearts. Thus our peril
will be lessened, and we shall be helped to walk in
the right way, through His grace. Our strong passions
will grow weaker, and our weak virtues stronger, day
by day.</p>

<p>And such a petition should check all overweening
confidence in our own power to withstand temptation,
all overreadiness to put ourselves in the way of danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
that we may show our strength, and that we can stand
though others may fall. The sin and folly of such
presumption would be constantly present to St. Peter's
mind. He could not forget how his own faith failed
when he would make a show of it by walking to meet
Jesus over the sea of Galilee. Still less could he forget
that utterance of self-confidence, which thought scorn
of trials to come, "Though I should die with Thee,
yet will I not deny Thee." It needed but the timid
suggestion of a servant-maid to call forth that manifestation
of feebleness for which only tears of deepest
penitence could atone, and which remained the darkest
memory in the Apostle's life. He above all men knew
to the full the need we have to pray, "Lead us not
into temptation."</p>

<p>And in respect of courting trial, even when the
suffering to be encountered would be allowed by all
men to be suffering for righteousness' sake, the New
Testament gives us many lessons that we should not
offer ourselves to unnecessary danger. Our Lord
Himself (John viii. 59), when the Jews took up stones
to cast at Him, hid Himself and conveyed Himself out
of harm's way. At another time we are told, "He
would not walk in Judæa because the Jews sought to
kill Him" (John vii. 1). St. Paul, too (2 Cor. xi. 33),
to avoid uncalled-for suffering, was let down by the
wall of Damascus, and afterwards made use of the dissensions
of the Pharisees and Sadducees (Acts xxiii. 6)
to divert the storm which their combined animosity
would have raised against him. In this spirit St. Peter
gives his counsel. "Make sure," he would say, "that
the trials you bear are sent to prove you. Let constant
self-questioning testify that they <em>are</em> proving you; then
wonder not that they are sent, but <em>rejoice inasmuch</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<em>as ye are partakers of the sufferings of Christ</em>." He who
thus learns the blessing of trial thanks the Lord for
his troublous days. He has a double joy, rejoicing
in this life, sorrowful yet alway rejoicing; and is
assured that at the revelation of Christ's glory his joy
shall be still more abundant.</p>

<p><em>If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are
ye.</em> It was a joy to the Apostles (Acts v. 41) at the
beginning of their ministry that they were counted
worthy to suffer dishonour for the name. Their offence
is described as speaking in the name of Jesus, and
filling Jerusalem with their teaching. The feeling of
their persecutors was so strong that they were minded
to slay them, but upon wiser counsel they only beat
them and let them go. St. Paul's commission to Damascus
(Acts ix. 14) was to bind all that called upon the
name of Christ, and his work after his conversion was
to be "to bear Christ's name before the Gentiles and
kings and the children of Israel." What such preaching
would be, we gather from St. Peter's words (Acts ii. 22).
They taught men that Jesus of Nazareth, a Man
approved of God by powers, and wonders, and signs,
had been crucified and slain by the Jews, but that God
had raised Him from the dead; that He was now exalted
by the right hand of God and was ordained of God
(Acts x. 42) to be the Judge of quick and dead; that
to Him all the prophets bare witness that through His
name every one that believeth on Him should receive
remission of sins. St. Paul and the rest preached the
same doctrine. All that had happened in Christ's life
was "according to the Scriptures" (1 Cor. xv. 3, 4)
of the Old Testament; Christ and Him crucified
(1 Cor. ii. 2), Jesus and the resurrection (Acts xvii. 18),
are the topics constant in his letters and on his lips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
And for their doctrine and their faith preachers and
hearers suffered persecution and reproach.</p>

<p>In our land suffering such as theirs is no more laid
upon us, but for all that the reproach of Christ has not
ceased. Our days are specially marked by a desire for
demonstration on every subject, and it comes to pass
thereby that those who are willing in spiritual things
to walk by faith rank in the estimation of many as the
less enlightened portion of the world, and are pictured
as such in much of our modern literature. All that
tells of miracle in the life of Jesus is by many cast
altogether aside, as alien to the reign of law under which
the world exists; and the Gospel narratives of the
virgin-birth, the wonderful works, the Resurrection, and
the Ascension are treated as the invention of the fervid
imaginations of the first followers of Jesus; while to
cling to them as verities, and to their importance and
significance in the work of the world's salvation, stamps
men as laggards in the march of modern speculation.
To accept the New Testament story as the fulfilment
of predictions in the Old is reckoned by many for
ungrounded superstition; and among the unbelieving
there are keen eyes still which gladly mark the slips
and stumblings of professing Christians, and throw the
obloquy of individuals broadcast upon the whole body.</p>

<p>To hold fast faith at such a time, to accept the
Gospels as true and their teaching as the words of
eternal life, to see in Christ the Redeemer appointed
from eternity by the foreknowledge of God, and to
believe that in Him His people find remission of sins,
to see and acknowledge above the reign of law the
power of the almighty Lawgiver&mdash;these things are still
beset with trials for those who will live in earnest
according to such faith; and if we receive less of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
blessing which St. Peter here speaks of as accompanying
the reproach of Christ, may we not fear that we exhibit
less of the zeal and fervour of the Christians to whom
he wrote?</p>

<p><em>Because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God
resteth upon you.</em> In the former clause the Apostle,
speaking of the joy of believers, exhorted the converts
to a present rejoicing, even in the midst of sufferings,
because these were borne for Christ's sake, that so,
when He shall appear in whose name they have
suffered, their rejoicing may be still more abundant.
In like manner he seems here to regard their blessedness
in a double aspect. The Spirit of glory rests
upon them. A power is imparted to them whereby
they accept their pains gladly, and therein glorify
God, and the same Spirit fills them with a sense of
future glory. Like Stephen before his persecutors,
they become filled with the Holy Ghost, their spirits
are lifted heavenwards, and even now they behold the
glory of God, and Jesus sitting on the right hand of
God. Thus suffering is robbed of its sting, and Christ's
reproach becomes a present blessing.</p>

<p>St. Paul combines the same thoughts in his appeal
to the Roman Christians. "Let us rejoice," he urges,
"in the hope of the glory of God" (Rom. v. 2). This
is the glory to be revealed in the presence of Jesus
Christ, that eternal weight of glory which affliction
worketh for us more and more exceedingly. But he
continues, "Let us rejoice also in our tribulations,"
knowing that by them we may glorify God in our
bodies, and that they are the pledge of glory to come.
"For tribulation worketh patience, and patience probation,
and probation hope, and hope putteth not to
shame"&mdash;it will not be disappointed; fruition will surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
come&mdash;"because the love of God hath been shed
abroad in our hearts through the Holy Ghost which
was given unto us." This is the Spirit of God of which
St. Peter here speaks. It rests like the cloud of glory
above the cherubim, and bestows all spiritual power
and blessing; it rests on the suffering believer, and
gives him rest.</p>

<p>The Authorised Version has here retained a clause
which appears to have been at first but an explanatory
note, written in the margin of some copy, and then to
have been incorporated with the text: "On their part
He is evil-spoken of, but on your part He is glorified."
We cannot regret the preservation of such a note.
It dates back to very early times. The student who
made it could write in the language of the New Testament
and in its spirit also. It gives us the sense which
was then felt to have most prominence and to be the
most important. The way of Christ was evil-spoken
of, and it could be no strange thing in those days for
His followers to be put to fiery trial. Yet the writer
feels that the blessedness of the believer is most secured
who, regardless of blasphemers around him, strives
with all his powers that in his body, whether by life
or by death, Christ shall be magnified.</p>

<h3><em>THE RIGHTEOUS HAVE JUDGEMENT HERE</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer,
or as a meddler in other men's matters: but if <em>a man suffer</em> as a
Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this
name. For the time <em>is come</em> for judgement to begin at the house of
God: and if <em>it begin</em> first at us, what <em>shall be</em> the end of them that
obey not the gospel of God? And if the righteous is scarcely saved,
where shall the ungodly and sinner appear? Wherefore let them
also that suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing
unto a faithful Creator."&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> iv. 15-19.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Apostle now goes one step farther in his
exhortations. The brethren are suffering for
Christ's cause, and may draw comfort from Christ's
example, and be encouraged to patience under their
persecutions. But these very sufferings, he would have
them see, are God's judgement on His servants in this
world, that they may be counted worthy of the kingdom
of God, for which they are called to suffer. They must
be watchful not to deserve punishment for offences that
bring disgrace on themselves and on the cause of
Christ.</p>

<p><em>For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief,
or an evil-doer, or as a meddler in other men's matters.</em>
He appears to divide these offences into two classes,
made distinct by the recurrence of &#8033;&#962;, "as." The first
three concern crimes of which the laws of any land
would naturally take cognisance. "Evil-doer" was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
word employed by the Jews when they brought our
Lord to Pilate: "If he were not an evil-doer, we
should not have delivered him up unto thee" (John
xviii. 30). The last-named offence, meddling in other
men's matters, would bring upon the Christians social
odium and render them generally unpopular; and it
was precisely the kind of conduct likely to prevail in
such a time. We have already found the Apostle
exhorting Christian subjects not to think lightly of the
duty of obedience to heathen rulers, and the like counsel
was given to Christian slaves with heathen masters
and to Christian wives with heathen husbands. Such
persons would often be tempted to step beyond their
province with advice, and perhaps remonstrance, and
to display a sense of superiority in so doing which
would be galling to those who were of another mind.
St. Peter's word to describe this fault is his own, but
the idea that such fault needed checking is not wanting
in the teaching of St. Paul, and may be taken as
evidence that such an interfering spirit prevailed. He
speaks of those "who work not at all, but are busybodies"
(2 Thess. iii. 11), and to Timothy of those who
are "tattlers and busybodies" (1 Tim. v. 13).</p>

<p>St. Peter has ranged these offences in a descending
order, placing the least culpable last; and their compass
embraces all that rightly might come under the ban of
the law or incur the just odium of society. To suffer
for such things would disgrace the Christian name;
but there is no shame in suffering as a Christian, but
rather a reason for giving glory to God. That the name
was bestowed as a reproach seems probable from Acts
xi. 26, and still more from the mocking tone in which
it is used by Agrippa (Acts xxvi. 28); and in the earliest
apologists we find this confirmed. "The accusation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
against us," says Justin Martyr, "is that we are Christians";
and in another place, "We ask that the actions
of all those who are accused before you should be
examined, so that he who is convicted may be punished
as a malefactor, but not as a Christian."</p>

<p><em>But if a man suffer as a Christian, let him not be
ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name.</em> That is,
let him be thankful and show his thankfulness that he
has been called to bear the name of Christ and to suffer
for it. The Authorised Version, adopting a different
reading, has "on this behalf." But the sense is nothing
different. He is to rejoice that this lot has befallen
him, for it is of God's great mercy that we are purified
here by trial; he who has not been tried has not
entered on the way of salvation. "Let me fall into the
hand of the Lord," was the petition of David; and they
are more blessed who feel that hand in their correction
than those who are cut away from it. It is a terrible
lot to think of, if we be abandoned by Him to worldly
prosperity. St. Paul congratulates the Philippians
"because to them it had been granted, in the behalf
of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer
on His behalf" (Phil. i. 29); and to another Church (Eph.
iii. 13) he declares that his own tribulations, endured
for their sakes, ought to be to them a glory, because
they made known how precious those believers were in
the sight of their heavenly Father for whose sake He
allowed another to be afflicted that they might be drawn
more effectually unto Him. And if this be so, how
much cause have they to bless and glorify God who
may be permitted to think that He is using their
afflictions for a like purpose.</p>

<p><em>For the time is come for judgement to begin at the house
of God.</em> The time is come. Why does the Apostle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
speak thus? Because the final era of Divine revelation
has begun. God has spoken unto men by His Son,
and He by His incarnation and death has brought life
and immortality to light. The new and living way is
opened. We live in the fulness of time, when the
faithful, having the testimony of those who companied
with Christ, can love Him, though they see Him not,
can rejoice in Him, and can receive, with full assurance,
the end of their faith, even the salvation of their souls.
Such souls have their judgement here. With them
God's judgement is neither postponed, nor is it penal.
It is disciplinary and corrective both for themselves and
others. They are the house of God, the pillar and
ground of the truth, and can be set forth as the salt of
the earth, the light of the world. Of such judgement
and its purpose St. Paul also speaks to the Corinthians:
"When we" (the servants of Christ) "are judged" (by
suffering in this life), "we are chastened of the Lord,
that we may not be condemned with the world" (1 Cor.
xi. 32). All chastening while it lasts is grievous, yet
afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit unto them that
have been exercised thereby. And by such chastisement
God prepares Him witnesses to the truth and
preciousness of Christianity; and so long as this
time, which is now come, shall continue, so long will
God try, and make judgement of, His servants in every
generation.</p>

<p>In St. Peter's words we have an echo of prophecy.
When the hand of the Lord carried Ezekiel in vision
back from Babylon to Jerusalem, he heard the voice of
God commanding the destroyers, "Begin at My sanctuary"
(Ezek. ix. 6). Yet in that evil age some were
found who had been sighing and crying for all the
abominations that were done in the midst of the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
These holy ones, living in a naughty world, were God's
witnesses, feeling His judgements, but receiving His
mark on their foreheads, that they should not be
destroyed with the sinners. Years passed away, and
at length the Lord of the Temple has Himself come.
He began His judgement at the house of God, casting
out all that defiled it. But it then had become a mere
"house of merchandise"; nay, at a later day He
named it "a den of thieves." At last He left it for
ever. Then it ceased to be God's house, and though
it was spared some forty years, its fate was fixed when
He went forth from it (Matt. xxiv. 1, 2) and said that
not one stone of it should be left upon another.
Henceforth He will have other temples in the hearts
of those who worship Him in spirit and in truth.
These are now the house of God. With them He
exercises judgement constantly for their instruction
and amendment. But it shall turn unto them for a
testimony in the end. Not a hair of their head shall
perish; in their patience they shall win their souls.</p>

<p><em>And if it begin first at us, what shall be the end of them
that obey not the gospel of God?</em> The Apostle joins
himself with those of the house of God who will feel
the pressure of temporal judgement. He is not forgetful
of the Lord's saying, "Simon, behold Satan
asked to have you that he might sift you as wheat, but
I made supplication for thee that thy faith fail not" (Luke
xxii. 31). He knows that he will be tried, but the end
to him and all the faithful is that they may be brought
into the Father's home. To those who obey not the
Gospel the doom pronounced against the Temple answers
the Apostle's question. They have had their days of
probation, and are like to Jerusalem at the time of the
Lord's lamentation, "If thou hadst known in this day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the things which belong unto peace! but now they are
hid from thine eyes" (Luke xx. 42). They cannot be
said to disobey a law of which they have not heard;
the glad tidings have been preached unto them, but
have found no welcome. As of the doomed city, so of
them, it may be said, "Ye would not." After their
hardness and their impenitent heart, they have treasured
up for themselves wrath in the day of the revelation of
the righteous judgement of God.</p>

<p><em>And if the righteous scarcely is saved, where shall the
ungodly and sinner appear?</em> The righteous is he who
follows after righteousness, but who feels that, in the
midst of his efforts of faith, he needs to cry, "Lord, I
believe; help Thou mine unbelief." It is of God's mercy
that He accepts the aim and purpose of our lives, and
counts not by their results. All men are beset with
temptation; in many things we all offend. Works of
righteousness bear the taint; they come many a time
from wrong motives. The best of us need both the
Father's chastisement, and, like Peter, the Saviour's
prayers, and the Holy Spirit's guidance. This is what
the Apostle means by "scarcely saved." By Divine help
Christ's servants are brought nearer and nearer to the
ideal, "Be ye holy." But though they live not in sin,
sin lives in them; and the warfare with evil is not ended
till the burden of the flesh is laid aside. And as there
are degrees in the progress of the righteous up the hill
of faith, so are there in the falling away of the wicked;
and St. Peter in his language appears to have had this
in mind, for of the ungodly and sinner he uses a verb
in the singular (&#966;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#945;&#953;). Where shall <em>he</em> appear?
The man begins as the ungodly, a negative character:
he thinks not of God; has no reverence for His law;
puts Him away from all his thoughts. But in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
state he will not long remain. There is no standing
still in things spiritual. He who does not advance
goes backward, and the ungodly soon becomes the
wilful sinner. So sure is this development that the
Apostle combines the two aspects of the wicked man's
life, and asks, not, Where shall they, but Where shall
he, appear?</p>

<p>For the judgement which for the righteous begins at
God's house, and is wrought out in the trials of this
life, awaits the disobedient when life is ended. The
Apostle leaves his solemn question unanswered; but
at that day there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
only a fearful expectation of judgement. It is a fearful
thing to fall into the hands of the living God then.
Hence the greater blessedness of those who are taken
into God's hand of judgement now. And thus the
Apostle comforts the sufferers.</p>

<p><em>Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the
will of God commit their souls in well-doing unto a
faithful Creator.</em> Again St. Peter goes back in thought
to the words of Christ, "Father, into Thy hands I commend
My spirit" (Luke xxiii. 46); and on these he
builds his final exhortation, which contains within it consolation
in abundance. The test of the faithful is his
perfect trust. "Though He slay me, yet will I trust
in Him" (Job xiii. 15), was the confession which marked
Job as more righteous than his advisers. The Revised
Version has varied the rendering of the final words in
that passage in such wise as to explain how the trust
is to be exhibited: "I will wait for Him"&mdash;wait, sure
that the event will be for my comfort and His glory.
This is the spirit which waxes strong in trial. "They
that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength"
(Isa. xl. 31), says the prophet. "None that wait on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Lord shall be ashamed," is an oft-repeated testimony
of the psalmists (Psalms xxv. 3; xxxvii. 34; lxix. 6);
and one whose name is a synonym for suffering tells us,
"The Lord is good unto them that wait for Him"
(Lam. iii. 25). To such trust St. Peter here exhorts,
bidding specially them that suffer to rest on the Lord.
Though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is
their hope full of immortality, for the souls of the
righteous are in the hand of God, a trust which they
repose in Him while they live here, a treasure guarded
by Him in the world to come. St. Paul knows of the
efficacy of this perfect trust, for he writes to Timothy,
"We labour and strive," counting bodily suffering as
nothing, "because we have our hope set on the living
God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them
that believe" (1 Tim. iv. 10).</p>

<p>The Apostle links a holy life most closely with this
trust in God. In well-doing commit your souls unto
Him. No otherwise can His guardianship and aid be
hoped for. But the Lord knoweth the way of the
righteous, and with Him to know is to watch over and
help. Nor should men sorrow when they suffer according
to God's will. Rather it is cause for gladness.
For conscience must tell them that they need to be
purged from much earthly dross which clings about
them. So the fire of trial may be counted among
blessings.</p>

<p>And with two words of exceeding comfort St. Peter
strengthens the believers in their trust. God is faithful;
His compassions fail not: they are new every morning.
In moments of despair the sorrowing Christian may
feel tempted to cry out, with the Psalmist, "Hath God
forgotten to be gracious? hath He in anger shut up His
tender mercies?" (Psalm lxxvii. 10), but as he looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
back on the path where God has led him he is convinced
of the unwisdom of his questioning, and cries
out, "This is my infirmity; I will remember the years
of the right hand of the Most High."</p>

<p>And this faithful God is our Creator. In the council
of the Godhead it was said in the beginning, "Let us
make man in our image." And God breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life, which made of him a living
soul. From God's hand he came forth very good, but
sin entered, and the Divine image has been blurred
and defaced. Yet in mercy the same heavenly conclave
planned the scheme for man's restoration to his first
estate. The love which spake to Zion of old speaks
through Christ to all mankind. "Can a woman forget
her sucking child? Yea, she may forget; yet will I not
forget thee" (Isa. xlix. 15). In the fulness of time God
has sent His Son to take hold upon the sons of men, to
wear their likeness, to live on earth and die for the
souls which He has made. Trust, says the Apostle,
in this almighty, unchanging love; trust God, your
Father, your Creator. He will succour you against all
assaults of evil; He will comfort and support you
when it is His desire to prove you; He will crown you,
with your Lord, when trials are no more.</p>

<h3><em>HOW TO TEND THE FLOCK</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"The elders therefore among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder,
and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of
the glory that shall be revealed: Tend the flock of God which is
among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly,
according unto God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making
yourselves ensamples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd
shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth
not away."&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> v. 1-4.</p></blockquote>


<p>St. Peter's last lesson was full of consolation.
He showed that it was from God's hand that
judgements were sent upon His people to purify them
and prepare them for His appearing. With this
thought in their minds, he would have the converts
rejoice in their discipline, confident in the faithfulness
of Him who was trying them. He follows this general
message to the Churches with a solemn charge to their
teachers. They are specially responsible for the
welfare of the brethren. On them it rests by the
holiness of their lives and the spirit in which they
labour to win men to the faith. <em>The elders therefore
among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness
of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the
glory that shall be revealed: Tend the flock of God which
is among you.</em> <em>Therefore</em>&mdash;because I know that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
blessed purpose of trial is not always manifest, and
because the hope of the believer needs to be constantly
pointed to the faithfulness of God&mdash;I exhort you to tend
zealously those over whom you are put in charge.
"Elders" was the name given at first to the whole body
of Christian teachers. No doubt they were chosen
at the beginning from the older members of the
community, when the Apostles established Churches
in their missionary journeys. "They appointed for
them elders in every Church" (Acts xiv. 23); and it
was the elders of the Church of Ephesus that Paul
sent for to Miletus (Acts xx. 17). And St. Peter here
contrasts them very pointedly with those of younger
years, whom he addresses afterwards. But after it
became an official title the sense of seniority would
drop away from the word.</p>

<p>It is clear from this passage that in St. Peter's time
they were identical with those who were afterwards
named bishops. For the word which follows presently
in the text and is rendered "exercising the oversight"
is literally "doing the work of bishop, or overseer."
And in the passage already alluded to (Acts xx. 15-28)
those who at first are called elders are subsequently
named bishops: "The Holy Ghost hath made you
bishops to feed the Church of God" (R.V.). As the
Church grew certain places would become prominent
as centres of Christian life, and to the elders therein the
oversight of other Churches would be given; and thus
the overseer or bishop would grow to be distinct from
the other presbyters, and his title be assigned to the
more important office. This had not come about when
St. Peter wrote.</p>

<p>The humility, which he is soon about to commend
to the whole body, the Apostle manifests by placing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
himself on the level of those to whom he speaks: "I,
who am a fellow-elder, exhort you." He has strong
claims to be heard, claims which can never be theirs.
He has been a witness of the sufferings of Christ. He
might have made mention of his apostleship; he might
have told of the thrice-repeated commission which soon
supplies the matter of his exhortation. He will rather
be counted an equal, a fellow-labourer with themselves.
Some have thought that even when he calls himself a
witness of Christ's sufferings he is not so much
referring to what he saw of the life and death of Jesus,
as to the testimony which he has borne to his Master
since the pentecostal outpouring and the share which
he has had of sufferings for Christ's sake. If this be
so, he would here too be reckoning himself even as
they, as he clearly intends to do in the words which
follow, where he calls himself a sharer, as they all are,
in the glory to which they look forward. Thus in all
things they are his brethren: in the ministry, in their
affliction, and in their hope of glory to be revealed.</p>

<p>He opens his solemn charge with words which are
the echo of Christ's own: "Feed My sheep"; "Feed
My lambs." Every word pictures the responsibility of
those to whom the trust is committed. These brethren
are God's flock. Psalmists and prophets had been
guided of old to use the figure; they speak of God's
people as "the sheep of His pasture." But our Lord
consecrated it still more when He called Himself "the
good Shepherd, that giveth His life for the sheep."
The word tells much of the character of those to whom
it is applied. How prone they are to wander and
stray, how helpless, how ill furnished with means of
defence against perils. It tells, too, that they are easy
to be led. But that is not all a blessing, for though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
docile, they are often heedless, ready to follow any
leader without thought of consequences.</p>

<p>But they are God's flock. This adds to the dignity
of the elder's office, but adds also to the gravity of the
trust, a trust to be entered on with fear and trembling.
For the flock is precious to Christ, and should be
precious to His shepherds. To let them perish for want
of tending is treachery to the Master who has sent men
to His work. And how much that tending means.
To feed them is not all, though that is much. To
provide such nurture as will help their growth in grace.
There is a food store in God's word, but not every
lesson there suits every several need. There must be
thoughtful choice of lessons. The elders of old were,
and God's shepherds now are, called to give much care
how they minister, lest by their oversight or neglect&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"The hungry sheep look up, but are not fed."
</p>

<p>But tending speaks of watchfulness. The shepherd
must yield his account when the chief Shepherd shall
appear. Those who are watchmen over God's flock
must have an eye to quarters whence dangers may
come, must mark the signs of them and be ready with
safeguards. And the sheep themselves must be
strengthened to endure and conquer when they are
assailed; they cannot be kept out of harm's way
always. Christ did not pray for His own little flock
of disciples that they should be taken out of the world,
only kept from the evil. Then all that betokens good
must be cherished among them. For even tiny germs
of goodness the Spirit will sanctify, and help the
watchful elder, by his tending, to rear till they flourish
and abound.</p>

<p>To his general precept St. Peter adds three defining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
clauses, which tell us how the elder's duty may be
rightly discharged, and against what perils and temptations
he will need to strive: <em>exercising the oversight,
not of constraint, but willingly, according unto God</em>.
How would the oversight of an elder come to be
exercised of constraint in the time of St. Peter?
Those to whom he writes had been appointed to their
office by apostolic authority, it may have been by St.
Paul himself; and while an Apostle was present to
inspire them enthusiasm for the new teaching would
be at its height: many would be drawn to the service
of Christ who would appear to the missionaries well
fitted to be entrusted with such solemn charge and
ministry. But even an Apostle cannot read men's
hearts, and it was when the Apostles departed that
the Churches would enter on their trial. Then the
fitness of the elders would be put to the test. Could
they maintain in the Churches the earnestness which
had been awakened? Could they in their daily walk
sustain the apostolic character, and help forward the
cause both by word and life? Christianity would be
unlike every other movement whose officers are human
if there were not many failures and much weakness
here and there; and if the ministrations of elders
grew less accepted and less fruitful, they would be
offered with ever-diminishing earnestness, and the
services, full of life at the outset, would prove irksome
from disappointment, and in the end be discharged
only as a work of necessity.</p>

<p>And every subsequent age of the Church has endorsed
the wisdom of St. Paul's caution, "Lay hands
hastily on no man." Fervid zeal may grow cool, and
inaptitude for the work become apparent. Nor are
those in whom it is found always solely responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
for a mistaken vocation. As St. Paul's words should
make those vigilant whose office it is to send forth men
to sacred ministries, so St. Peter's warning should
check any undue urging of men to offer themselves.
It is a sight to move men to sorrow, and God to
displeasure, when the shepherd's work is perfunctory,
not done willingly, according to God.</p>

<p>In some texts the last three words are not represented,
nor are they found in our Authorised Version.
But they have abundant authority, and so fully declare
the spirit in which all pastoral work should be done
that they might well be repeated emphatically with
each of these three clauses. To labour <em>according to
God</em>, "as ever in the great Taskmaster's eye," is so
needful that the words may be commended to the elders
as a constant motto. And not only as in His sight
should the work be done, but with an endeavour after
the standard which is set before us in Christ. We are
to stoop as He stooped that we may raise those who
cannot raise themselves; to be compassionate to the
penitent, breaking no bruised reed, quenching no spark
in the smoking flax. The pastor's words should be
St. Paul's, "We are your servants for Jesus's sake," his
action that of the shepherd in the parable: "When he
findeth it, he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing." Such
joy comes only to willing workers.</p>

<p><em>Nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.</em> We do
not usually think of the Church in the apostolic age as
offering any temptation to the covetous. The disciples
were poor men, and there is little trace of riches in the
opening chapters of the Acts. St. Paul, too, constantly
declined to be a burden to the flock, as though he felt
it right to spare the brethren. The lessons of the New
Testament on this subject are very plain. When our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Lord sent forth His seventy disciples, He sent them
as "labourers worthy of their hire" (Luke x. 7); and
St. Paul declares it to be the Lord's ordinance that they
which proclaim the Gospel should live of the Gospel
(1 Cor. ix. 14). To serve with a ready mind is to seek
nothing beyond this. But it is clear both from St.
Paul's language (1 Tim. iii. 3; Titus i. 7) and from this
verse that there existed temptations to greed, and that
some were overcome thereby. It is worthy of note,
however, that those who are given up to this covetousness
are constantly branded with false teaching. They
are thus described by both the Apostles. They teach
things which they ought not (Titus i. 11), and with
feigned words make merchandise of the flock (2 Peter
ii. 3). The spurt of self-seeking and base gain (which
is the literal sense of St. Peter's word) is so alien to
the spirit of the Gospel that we cannot conceive a faithful
and true shepherd using other language than that
of St. Paul: "We seek not yours, but you."</p>

<p><em>Neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but
making yourselves ensamples to the flock.</em> This, too, is a
special peril at all times for those who are called to
preside in spiritual offices. The interests committed to
their trust are so surpassingly momentous that they
must often speak with authority, and the Church's
history furnishes examples of men who would make
themselves lords where Christ alone should be Lord.
Against this temptation He has supplied the safeguard
for all who will use it. "My sheep," He says, "hear
My voice." And the faithful tenders of His flock must
ever ask themselves in their service, Is this the voice
of Christ? The question will be in their hearts as
they give counsel to those who need and seek it,
What would Christ have said to this man or to that?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
The same sort of question will bring to the test their
public ministrations, and will make that most prominent
in them which He intended to be so. Thus will be
introduced into all they do a due proportion and
subordination, and many a subject of disquiet in the
Churches will thereby sink almost into insignificance.
At the same time the constant reference to their own
Lord will keep them in mind that they are His servants
for the flock of God.</p>

<p>While he warns the elders against the assumption of
lordship over their charges, the Apostle adds a precept
which, if it be followed, will abate all tendency to seek
such lordship. For it brings to the mind of those set
over the flock that they too are but sheep, like the rest,
and are appointed not to dominate, but to help their
brethren. <em>Making yourselves ensamples to the flock.</em>
Christ's rule for the good shepherd is, "He goeth
before them, and the sheep follow him" (John x. 4).
The weak take in teaching rather from what they see
than from what they hear. The teacher must be a living
witness to the word, a proof of its truth and power.
If he be not this, all his teaching is of little value. The
simplest teacher who lives out his lessons in his life
becomes a mighty power; he gains the true, the
lawful lordship, and&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"Truth from his lips prevails with double sway."<br />
</p>

<p>The Apostles knew well the weight and influence
of holy examples. Hence St. Paul appeals continually
to the lives of himself and his fellow-workers. We
labour, he says, "to make ourselves an ensample unto
you that ye should imitate us" (2 Thess. iii. 9);
Timothy he exhorts, "Be thou an ensample to them
that believe" (1 Tim. iv. 12), and Titus, "In all things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
showing thyself an ensample of good works" (Titus ii.
7). Nothing can withstand the eloquence of him who
can dare to appeal to his brethren, as the Apostle does,
"Be ye imitators together of me, and mark them which
walk so as ye have us for an ensample" (Phil. iii. 7),
and "Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of
Christ" (1 Cor. xi. 1). Such pattern shepherds have
been the admiration of every age. Chaucer, among his
pilgrims, describes the good parson thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"The lore of Christ and His Apostles twelve</div>
<div class="line">He taught, and first he followed it himself."</div>
</div></div>

<p>Such are the lives of shepherds who remember that
they are even as their flocks: frail and full of evil
tendencies, and needing to come continually, in humble
supplication, to the source of strength and light, and to
be ever watchful over their own lives. These men
seek no lordship; there comes to them a nobler power,
and the allegiance they win is self-tendered.</p>

<p><em>And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye
shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.</em>
For their consolation the Apostle sets before the elders
their Judge in His self-chosen character. He is the
chief Shepherd. Judge He must also be when He is
manifested; but while He must pass sentence on their
work, He will understand and weigh the many
hindrances, both within and without, against which they
have had to fight. Of human weakness, error, sin,
such as besets us, He had no share; but He knows
whereof we are made, and will not ask from any of us
a service beyond our powers. Nay, His Spirit chooses
for us, would we but mark it, the work in which we
can serve Him most fitly. And He has borne the
contradiction of sinners against Himself. In judging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
His servants, then, He will take account of the wilfulness
of ears that would not hear and of eyes that
would not see, of the waywardness that chose darkness
rather than light, ignorance rather than Divine knowledge,
death rather than life.</p>

<p>Therefore His feeble but faithful servants may with
humble minds welcome His appearing. He comes as
Judge. <em>Ye shall receive.</em> It is a word descriptive of
the Divine award at the last. Here it marks the
bestowal of a reward, but elsewhere (2 Peter ii. 13)
the Apostle uses it for the payment to sinners of the
hire of wrong-doing. But the Judge is full of mercy.
Of one sinner's feeble efforts He said, "She hath done
what she could. Her sins are forgiven." And another
who had laboured to be faithful He welcomed to His
presence: "Enter into the joy of thy Lord." To share
that joy, to partake of His glory, to be made like Him
by beholding His presence&mdash;this will be the faithful
servant's prize, a crown of amaranth, unwithering,
eternal.</p>

<h3><em>BE CLOTHED WITH HUMILITY</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you
gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth
the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves
therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in
due time; casting all your anxiety upon Him, because He careth
for you."&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> v. 5-7.</p></blockquote>


<p>Having admonished the shepherds, the Apostle
now turns to the flock, and his words recall the
exhortations which he has given several times before.
In ii. 13 he taught Christian subjects the duty of
submission, even should it be their lot to live under
heathen rulers. A few verses further on in the same
chapter he repeated this teaching to Christian slaves
with heathen masters, and the third chapter opens
with advice of the same character to the wives who
were married to heathen husbands. And now once
more, with his favourite verb "be subject," he opens
his counsel to the Churches on their duty to those set
over them. The relation between the elders and their
flock will not be as strained, or not strained after the
same manner, as between Christians and heathens in
the other cases, but the same principle is to govern the
behaviour of those who hold the subject position. The
duly appointed teachers are to be accepted as powers
ordained of God, and their rule and guidance followed
with submission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder.</em> He
teaches that as there is a duty of the elders to the
younger, so there is a reciprocal duty which, in like
manner and with the same thoroughness, must be
discharged by the younger to the elders. In those
early days the congregation could fitly be spoken of
as "the younger." Naturally the teachers would be
chosen from those who had been the first converts.
The rest of the body would consist not only of those
younger in years, but younger in the acceptance of the
faith, younger in the knowledge of the doctrines of
Christ, younger in Christian experience. And if the
Churches were to be a power among their heathen surroundings,
it must be by their unity in spirit and faith;
and this could only be secured by a loyal and ready
following of those who were chosen to instruct them.</p>

<p>But lest there may be any undue straining of the
claim to submission, there follows immediately a precept
to make it general: <em>Yea, all of you gird yourselves with
humility, to serve one another</em>. Thus will be realised the
true idea of the Christian body, where each member
should help all, and be helped of all, the rest, eye and
hand, head and feet, each having their office, and each
ministering therein as parts of the one body. This
idea of general humility was altogether unknown to the
world before Christ's coming. The word, therefore, is
one coined for Christian use: lowliness of mind, a
frame wherein each deems others better than himself.
And with it the Apostle has coupled another word for
"gird yourselves," which is well fitted to be so placed.
It is found nowhere else, and is full of that graphic
character of which he is so fond. The noun from
which it is derived signifies "an outer garment," mainly
used by household servants and slaves, to cover their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
other clothing and keep it from being spoiled. It
appears to have been bound round the waist by a
girdle. The word is a complete picture. St. Peter
sees in humility a robe which shall encompass the
whole life of the believer, keeping off all that might
sully or defile it; and into the sense of the word
comes the lowly estate of those by whom the garment
in question was worn. It was connected entirely with
the humblest duties. Hence its appropriateness when
joined with "serve one another."</p>

<p>And one cannot in studying this striking word of the
Apostle but be carried in thought to that scene described
by St. John where Jesus "took a towel and girded
Himself" (John xiii. 4) to wash the feet of His disciples.
St. Peter gained much instruction from that washing,
and he has not forgotten the lesson when he desires
to confirm the brethren in Christian humility. "I have
given you an example, that ye also should do as I have
done to you," was the Lord's injunction; and this the
Apostle delivers to the Churches. And verily Christ
spake of Himself more truly than of any other when
He described the master's treatment of his watchful
servants: "He shall gird himself, and make them sit
down to meat, and shall come and serve them" (Luke
xii. 37). Such has been the Lord's humiliation, who
took upon Him our flesh, and now bids us to His
banquet, where, through His Spirit, He is ever waiting
to bless those who draw near.</p>

<p>How this exhortation to humility in dealing with
one another is connected with the verse (Prov. iii. 34)
by which the Apostle supports it does not perhaps
immediately appear. <em>For God resisteth the proud, but
giveth grace to the humble.</em> But a little reflection on
the characteristics of pride towards men soon makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
us conscious that it is very closely united with pride
towards God. The Pharisee who despises the publican,
and thanks God in words that he is not such a one, feels
in his heart no thankfulness nor care for God at all.
His own acts have made him the pattern of goodness
which he conceives himself to be. And we discover the
like in every other exhibition of this spirit. The term
(&#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8053;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#953;) by which these haughty ones are described
indicates a desire to be conspicuous, to stand
apart from and above their fellows. They are self-centred,
and look down upon the rest of the world, and
forget their dependence upon God.</p>

<p>St. Peter in his quotation has followed the Septuagint.
In the Hebrew the first half of the verse is, "He
scorneth the scorners." And this is the manner of
God's dealing. He pays men with their own coin.
Jacob's deceit was punished in kind by the frequent
deceptions of his children, so that at last he could hardly
credit their report that Joseph is still alive. David was
scourged for his offences exactly according to his own
sin. But the word which the Apostle has drawn from
the Septuagint is also of solemn import. It declares a
state of war between God and man. God <em>resisteth</em> the
proud; literally, He setteth Himself in array against
them. And their overthrow is sure. They that
strive with the Lord shall be broken to pieces. The
Psalmist rejoices over the contrary lot: "The Lord is
on my side; I will not fear. What can man do unto
me?" (Psalm cxviii. 6). He had realised the feebleness
of human strength, even for man to rely on, much more
if it stand in opposition to God. "It is better to trust
in the Lord than to put any confidence in man," be it
in ourselves or in others. So out of his distress he
called upon the Lord. It is the sense of need which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
makes men humble; and to humbled souls God's
blessing comes: "He answered me, and set me in a
large place."</p>

<p>And as though He would mark humility as the chief
grace to prepare men for His kingdom, the Lord's first
words in His sermon on the mount are a blessing on
the lowly-minded: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven"&mdash;not shall be, but
<em>is</em> theirs even now. God's favour to the humble is
a present gift. How the sense of this swells the
thanksgivings of Hannah and the Virgin Mary! And
to teach the lesson to His disciples, when they were
far from humility and were anxious only to know
which of them should be above the rest in what they
still dreamt of as an earthly kingdom, He took a little
child and set him before them, as the pattern to which
His true followers must conform. This childlike virtue
gives admission to the kingdom of heaven; its possessors
have the kingdom of God within them.</p>

<p>And St. Peter feeds the flock as he himself was fed.
<em>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of
God, that He may exalt you in due time.</em> The Apostle
may be referring in these words to the trials which
were upon the converts when he wrote to them. These
he would have them look upon as God's discipline, as
a cause for joy rather than sorrow. Christian humility
will not rebel against fatherly, merciful correction. How
the good man bows before the hand of God we see in
Moses when God refused to let him go over into
Canaan: "I besought the Lord, saying, O Lord God,
Thou hast begun to show Thy servant Thy greatness
and Thy strong hand.... Let me go over, I pray Thee,
and see the good land that is beyond Jordan. But the
Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, and hearkened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
not unto me" (Deut. iii. 23). And so the meek
prophet, who knew that his withdrawal was for the
people's sake, having sung, "Happy art thou, O Israel;
who is like unto thee, a people saved by the Lord?"
(Deut. xxxiii. 29), went up unto Mount Nebo and died
there, when his eye was not dim, nor his natural force
abated. Hence his praise: "There hath not arisen a
prophet since in Israel like unto Moses." Humility
was his dying lesson.</p>

<p>But as the Apostle has just been speaking of the
duty owed to the elders as teachers, it is perhaps better
to apply the words of the exhortation in that sense.
Those who were set over the Churches were so set in
the Lord. For the time they represented His hand,
the hand of care and guidance to those who were
submissive. In honouring them, the younger were
honouring God. Thus the lesson would be, Bend
your hearts to the instruction which He imparts through
their words; yield your will to His will, and order
your life to be in harmony with His providence; live
thus that He may exalt you. For the hand which may
seem heavy now will be mighty to raise you in due time.
And that time He knows. It is His time, not yours.
If it tarry, wait for it. It will surely come; it will not
tarry, when the Divine discipline has done its work.</p>

<p><em>Casting all your anxiety upon Him, because He careth
for you.</em> When men do this the due time has come.
Till this stage is reached there can be no true humility.
But how slow men are in reaching it! We are willing
to bring to God a little here and there of our sorrow
and our feebleness, but would fain still carry a part
of the load ourselves. Human pride it is which cannot
stoop to owe everything to God; want of faith, too,
both in the Divine power and the Divine love, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
our tongues may not confess it. What a powerful
homily on this verse is the conduct of the youthful
David when he went forth against the Philistine!
"The Lord," he says to Saul, "that delivered me out
of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear,
He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine."
And when the king offered his own coat of mail, though
tempted thereby, he put the armour away, saying, "I
cannot go with these, for I have not proved them."
He knew that God had given him skill with the humbler
weapons, and it was God's battle in which he was to
engage. So with his stones and his sling he went
forth, telling the defiant challenger, "I come to thee
in the name of the Lord of hosts." The action is a
comment on the Psalmist's words, "Commit thy way
unto the Lord, trust also in Him, and He shall bring
it to pass" (Psalm xxxviii. 5).</p>

<p>But neither the young hero by his example, nor the
Apostle in his exhortation, teaches a spirit of careless
indifference and neglect of means. David chose him
five smooth stones out of the brook. These he could
use. With these God had delivered him aforetime.
And in every condition men are bound to use the best
means they know to ensure success, and the Christian
will pour out his prayers for guidance and foresight in
temporal concerns. That done, the counsel of Christ,
on which St. Peter's exhortation is grounded, is, "Be
not overanxious; your heavenly Father knoweth
your needs." And he who has grown humble under
the mighty hand of God in trials has learnt that the
same hand is mighty to save: "He careth for you."
When this perfect trust is placed in God, the load is
lifted. It is, as the Psalmist says literally, <em>rolled</em> upon
the Lord (Psalm xxxviii. 5).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>How salutary this teaching for both the elders and
the congregations among these Christians of the
dispersion, and how full the promise of help and
blessing. The teachers had been placed in the midst
of difficulties and charged with a mighty responsibility;
but robed in the garment of humility, casting aside all
self-trust, coming only in the name of the Lord, the
burden would be raised by the almighty arms and
made convenient to their powers. And to the younger
the same lowly spirit, loving thoughts toward those
who cared for their souls, would be fruitful in blessing.
For the same God who resisteth the proud showers
His grace upon the humble. It falls on them as the
dew of Hermon, which cometh down upon the
mountains of Zion. Unto them Christ has proclaimed
His foremost blessing; has promised, and is giving,
the kingdom of heaven to humble souls, and will give
them life for evermore.</p>

<h3><em>THROUGH PERILS TO VICTORY</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion,
walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: whom withstand
steadfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished
in your brethren who are in the world. And the God of

that ye have suffered a little while, shall Himself perfect, stablish,

unto you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace
of God: stand ye fast therein. She that is in Babylon, elect together
with <em>you</em>, saluteth you; and <em>so doth</em> Mark my son. Salute one
another with a kiss of love.</p>

<p>"Peace be unto you all that are in Christ."&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> v. 8-14.</p></blockquote>


<p>Not only had these Asian Christians to suffer from
the opposition and calumnies of the heathen and
from the estrangement of former friends: there were
perils within the Churches themselves. There were
weak brethren, who fell away when trials came, and
infected others with their despondency; there were
false brethren, with whom faith was a mere consent
of the understanding, and not the spring of a holy,
spiritual life. These spake of the liberty of Christ
as though it were an emancipation from all moral
restraints. Such dangers asked for firmness both in
the elders and their hearers. To withstand them there
must be a constant growth in Christian experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
whereby the faithful might wax steadfast, and attain
to the strength and stature of the fulness of Christ.
These dangers became more manifest before St. Peter
wrote his second letter, where we find them described
in dark colours.</p>

<p>Here to the converts, exposed to the assaults of these
temptations, he enjoins the same well-ordered frame
of mind which before (i. 13) he commended to them
as they looked forward to the hope in store for them,
and also (iv. 7) in their prayers, that their petitions
might be such as suited with the approaching end
of all things. <em>Be sober</em>, he says again, and combines
therewith an exhortation which without sobriety is
impossible: <em>Be watchful</em>. If the mind be unbalanced,
there can be no keeping of a true guard against such
dangers as were around these struggling believers.
And it is impossible not to connect such an exhortation
from his lips with those words of Christ, which one
Evangelist says were expressly addressed to St. Peter,
"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation"
(Mark xiv. 37, 38). He who had received this admonition
was conscious that, as in his own case, so with
these his converts, the spirit might be willing, but the
flesh was weak, and the enemy mighty.</p>

<p><em>Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh
about, seeking whom he may devour.</em> In the days of
Job, when God asked of Satan, "Whence comest thou?"
his answer was, "From going to and fro in the earth
and from walking up and down in it" (Job i. 7). Of this
Old Testament language the Apostle here makes partial
use in his description of the enemy of mankind. He
walketh about in the earth, which is his province, for
he is called the prince of this world (John xii. 31) and
the god of this world (2 Cor. iv. 4). And the Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
word &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#8055;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962;, "adversary," which St. Peter uses as
a translation of the Hebrew "Satan," is well chosen, for
it describes not an ordinary enemy, but one who acts
as an opponent would in a court of law. Such was
Satan from the first, an accuser. In Job's case he
accused the Patriarch to his God: "Doth Job serve
God for nought?" "Put forth Thine hand now, and
touch all that he hath, or touch his bone and his flesh,
and he will curse Thee to Thy face." In earlier
days he appears as the accuser of God Himself: "Ye
shall not surely die, for God doth know that in the
day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened, and
ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil" (Gen.
iii. 4, 5). And with such-like suggestions he assails
the faithful continually, speaking either to their unguarded
hearts, or by the words of his servants, of
whom he has no lack. St. Paul dreaded his power
for the Thessalonian converts: "I sent that I might
know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had
tempted you, and our labour should be in vain"
(1 Thess. iii. 5). And St. Peter's words are dictated
by the same fear; he has the same wish to keep
the flock steadfast in their faith. To them Satan's
whisperings would be after this sort: "You are forgotten
of God"; "Love could never leave you so long
in trial." Or his agents would say in scorn, "How
can you talk of freedom, when your life is one long
torment? What is the profit of faith, when it gives
you no liberty?" And such questions are perilous
to feeble minds. The Apostle marks the great danger
by a comparison which Ezekiel (xxii. 25) had used
before him, speaking of the tempter as a roaring lion,
ever hungry for his prey. There is but one weapon
which can vanquish him. "This is the victory that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
hath overcome the world, even our faith" (1 John v. 4).
St. Peter's lesson is the same as St. John's.</p>

<p><em>Whom withstand steadfast in your faith, knowing that
the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren
who are in the world.</em> The steadfast faith must be the
firm foundation of God; and the same thoughts, which
St. Paul commends as a correction of those who
have erred concerning the truth, are those most fit to
be urged upon St. Peter's converts to render them
steadfast. "The Lord knoweth them that are His"
(2 Tim. ii. 19), and with the Lord to know is to care
for and to save. And "let every one that nameth
the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."
This is the perfect law, the law of true liberty, and
he who continueth therein, being not a hearer that
forgetteth, but a doer that worketh, shall be blessed
in his doing. Thus resting on God and thus ruling
himself, he shall be kept from the snares of the enemy,
and having withstood in the evil day, shall still be
made able to stand.</p>

<p>And to such steadfastness the brethren are to be
moved by the knowledge that others are in the same
affliction. How shall such knowledge minister support?
The mere knowledge that others bear a like
burden does not strengthen our own shoulders; to
hear of others' pains will not relieve our own. Not
so. But just as it is a power in warfare when men
see their leader before them, facing the same perils,
hear his voice cheering them by his courage, inspiring
them with his hope; just as it is a support to brave
men to find brave brethren at their side in the conflict,
animated by the same spirit, marching forward to the same
victory, so is it in the Christian struggle. All Christians
are to be steadfast, the elders like the leaders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
an army, the younger like the soldiers who follow,
that, moving with one spirit against the foe, feeling that
each is like-minded with all the rest, while all are equally
conscious of the importance of victory, they may grasp
hands as they go forward, and be heartened thereby,
being sure that in the danger they will have helpers
at their side.</p>

<p>And that he may give the more emphasis to this
idea of unity, in which, though the suffering is common
to all, yet the hope is also common, and the victory
is promised to all, the Apostle does not speak of the
converts as a multitude of brethren, but uses a noun
in the singular number, naming them (as the margin
of the Revised Version indicates) "a brotherhood"
(&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#962;). And when they regarded themselves as
"a brotherhood in the world," the thought would have
its comforting as well as its painful aspect. The world,
as Scripture speaks of it, is void of faith. Hence the
believer, while he lives in it, is amid jarring surroundings,
and is sure to suffer. "In the world ye shall have
tribulation." But it is not to last for ever, nor for long.
"The world passeth away, but he that doeth the will
of God abideth for ever." And though the brotherhood
in the world must suffer, yet there is that other
brotherhood beyond; and there the suffering will not
be remembered for the glory that shall be revealed
in us.</p>

<p><em>And the God of all grace, who called you unto His
eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little
while, shall Himself perfect, stablish, strengthen you.</em>
Being now about to sum up the great work of Christian
advancement, in which from first to last the power is
bestowed by God, St. Peter finds no title more fitting
to express the Divine love than "the God of <em>all</em> grace."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
The invitation to become partakers of the glory which
Christ has won by His sufferings, won that He may
bestow it upon men, was God's free call. Our sufferings,
the discipline which the Father employs to purge
and purify us, are to last but a little while. Then those
whom He has called He will also justify, and those
whom He justifies He will in the end glorify. Thus
St. Paul (Rom. viii. 30) describes the operations of
Divine grace. St. Peter, with the same lesson, uses
words more after his own graphic manner. He gives
us a picture of God's work in its several stages. First
God will complete in all its parts the work which He
has begun. He will make it so that He can pronounce
it very good, as He did when the worlds <em>were perfected</em>
in the first creation (Heb. xi. 3), making His people
to be so <em>perfected</em> that they may be as their Master
(Luke vi. 40). Then He will sustain and support
that which He has brought to its best estate. There
shall not be, as in the first creation, any falling away.
New gifts shall be bestowed by the Holy Spirit,
through the ministration of the word. It was for such
a purpose that St. Paul longed to visit the Roman
Church, that he might impart unto them some spiritual
gift, to the end that they might be <em>established</em>. And
what has been perfected and established shall also by
the same grace be made strong, that it may endure
and withstand all assaults.</p>

<p>In many ancient texts a fourth verb is given, which
the Authorised Version renders "settle." It signifies
"to set on a firm foundation," and it is of the figurative
character which marks St. Peter's language, and, beside
this, is not uncommon in the New Testament (Matt.
vii. 25; Luke vi. 48; Heb. i. 10, etc.). But the verbs
immediately preceding have no direct reference to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
building, and the addition arises probably from a marginal
note, made to illustrate the text and by some
later scribe incorporated with it. The whole passage
brings to mind Christ's injunction to the Apostle,
"When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren."</p>

<p><em>To Him be the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</em>
A fitting doxology to follow the Apostle's enumeration
of the riches of Divine grace. He who feels that every
gift he has is from above will with ready thankfulness
welcome God's rule, and seek to submit himself thereto,
making it the law of his life here, as he hopes it will
be hereafter.</p>

<p><em>By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account him, I
have written unto you briefly.</em> Silvanus was that Silas
who accompanied St. Paul in his second missionary
journey through the districts of Phrygia and Galatia
(Acts xvi. 6), to which St. Peter addresses his letter.
To send it by the hand of one known and esteemed
among these Churches for his former labours and for
his friendship with the great Apostle of the Gentiles
would secure acceptance for it, while the bearer would
testify to the unity of the doctrine preached by the two
Apostles. He who had been a faithful brother to
St. Paul was so also to St. Peter, and was by him
commended to the Churches. For the expression, <em>I
account him</em>, implies no doubt or question in the Apostle's
own mind. It is the utterance of a matured opinion.
The verb (&#955;&#959;&#947;&#8055;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;) is that which St. Paul uses:
"I <em>reckon</em> that the sufferings of this present time are
not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall
be revealed in us" (Rom. viii. 18). To St. Paul something
of the future glory had been shown, and he had
felt abundance of present suffering. He had taken
account of both sides, and could speak with certainty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
The brevity of St. Peter's letter could be supplemented
by the words of his messenger. For Silas himself was
a prophet (Acts xv. 32), and fitted to exhort and
confirm the brethren.</p>

<p><em>Exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of
God: stand ye fast therein.</em> The grace in its several
stages has just been summarised: the calling, the perfecting,
stablishing, strengthening; and the whole letter
is occupied in showing that at every advance God puts
His servants to the test. But the Apostle knows that
agents of the adversary are busily scattering the
tares of doubt and disbelief where God had sown His
good seed. The wrestling is not against flesh and
blood alone, but against the world-rulers of this darkness,
against the spiritual host of wickedness. Hence
the form of his exhortation: <em>Stand fast</em>.</p>

<p><em>She that is in Babylon, elect together with you, saluteth
you; and so doth Mark my son. Salute one another with
a kiss of love.</em> It is most natural to refer these words
to a Church, and not to any individual. Some have
interpreted them as an allusion to St. Peter's wife,
whom, as we know from St. Paul (1 Cor. ix. 5), he
sometimes had as a companion in his travels. But
there is a degree of inappropriateness in speaking of
a single person as elect along with these various
Churches of Asia, whereas the Church in Babylon
might fitly have such a distinction. It is unnecessary,
too, to explain Babylon (as some have done) as intended
for Rome. There was no conceivable reason in
St. Peter's day why, when he was writing to lands
under Roman dominion, if he meant to speak of the
city in Italy, he should not call it by its real name.
The Mark here named was most probably the John
whose surname was Mark (Acts xii. 12), whose mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
was a friend of St. Peter's from the earliest days of
his apostolic labours. He, too, had been a companion
of St. Paul for a time, and made another link between
the two great Apostles. St. Peter calls him "son"
because it is likely that both the mother and her son
were won to the new teaching by him, and he employs
the term of affection just as St. Paul does of Timothy,
his convert (1 Tim. i. 2, 18; 2 Tim. i. 2). The salutation
by a kiss is frequently mentioned. It is called "a
holy kiss" (Rom. xvi. 16; 1 Cor. xvi. 20; 2 Cor. xiii.
12; 1 Thess. v. 26) in St. Paul's language. We find
from Justin Martyr<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> that it had come to be used in
his day as part of the ceremonial preceding the Holy
Communion. It was to be a token of perfect love,
according to the name which St. Peter here gives it.
An evil construction was soon put upon it by the
enemies of the faith; and after a long history it fell
into disuse, even in the East, where such manner of
salutation is more common than in the West. In his
final words the Apostle has embodied the benediction
of which the kiss was meant to be the symbol.</p>

<p><em>Peace be unto you all that are in Christ.</em> This is the
bond which unites believers into one fellowship. To
be in Christ is to be of the brotherhood which has
been so significantly marked just before for its unity.
And in these last clauses we have examples of the
force of the tie. Individuals are brought by it into
close communion, as Peter himself with Silas and with
Mark, whom he speaks of in terms of family love. To
the Churches Silas is commended as a brother in the
faith, which faith establishes a bond of strength between
the distant Churches which have been called into it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
together. Well might the heathen, wonderstruck,
exclaim, "See how these Christians love one another!"
And the Apostle's own words mark the all-embracing
character of the love: <em>all that are in Christ</em>. They are
all brethren, children of the common Father, inheritors
of the same promises, pilgrims on the same journey,
sustained by the same hope, servants of the same Lord,
and strengthened, guided, and enlightened by the one
Spirit, who is promised to abide with Christ's Church
for ever.</p>

have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our
God and Saviour Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied
in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord; seeing that His
Divine power hath granted unto us all things that pertain unto life
and godliness, through the knowledge of Him that called us by His
own glory and virtue; whereby He hath granted unto us His precious
and exceeding great promises; that through these ye may become
partakers of the Divine nature, having escaped from the corruption
that is in the world by lust."&mdash;2 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> i. 1-4.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the salutation of this second letter the Apostle
describes himself in fuller form than in the first:
<em>Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ</em>.
Some have seen in this description a testamentary
character, as though the Epistle contained his parting
counsels. The words form an epitome of his whole
life. As Simon, son of Jonas, he lived his life in
Judaism until Christ's call summoned him to be a fisher
of men. "Peter" is the Christ-given name, which marked
an advance in spiritual illumination, an advance that
fitted him to be one of the chief heralds of God manifest
in the flesh. As a servant (or rather, bondservant)
of Jesus Christ, he stands on the same level with those
to whom he writes, though the service to which he has
been called may be in character different from theirs.
Jesus had said to the twelve, and through them to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
whole body of believers, "One is your Master, even
the Christ. But he that is greatest among you shall
be your servant" (Matt. xxiii. 10). And here comes
forward that other aspect of Christian service. The
servants of Christ are, for His sake, servants to all the
brotherhood (2 Cor. iv. 5). As an apostle he speaks
with authority, an authority greater than can be
possessed by any future age. The solemn character
of the office is stamped by Christ's words, "As My
Father sent Me, even so send I you"; and the
Churches are reminded, as they think of the apostolic
office, that the Lord who commissioned the twelve to
be His servants said, "He that heareth you heareth
Me, and He that despiseth you despiseth Me."</p>

<p>St. Peter does not, as in his former letter, name the
Churches to which he is writing; but afterwards
(iii. 1) he states that this is his second letter to them.
We may therefore conclude that the same persons are
addressed as before. Here he speaks of them as <em>them
that have obtained a like precious faith with us in the
righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ</em>.
Some have thought that here the Apostle's words are
specially addressed to those among the converts who
had been won from heathendom, and now were made partakers
of the same faith with himself and others who, like
him, had been born Jews, and so heirs in part to God's
precious promises. But, as he has just made mention
of his apostolic office, it seems easier to refer "us"
to the Apostles. If this be the sense, then&mdash;though in
the allusion to his office and authority they must have
recognised the points wherein his communing with
Christ had made him to differ from them&mdash;these words
set forward that aspect of the Christian life wherein
all the faithful are equal. The graces, gifts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
opportunities which God bestows are according to
men's power to improve them; but faith, in its saving
efficacy and preciousness, is the same for every believer.
And when he speaks of this faith as being in the
righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
we see that he is thinking of righteousness in that
sense in which he uses the word afterwards in this
Epistle (iii. 13): as that perfect righteousness which
belongs to the new heavens and the new earth, and
hence to God Himself.</p>

<p>To this righteousness each "stranger and sojourner"
in the world is striving to attain by faith, and by each
exercise thereof he is raised nearer to his lofty aim.
His faith, like the patriarch's of old, is counted unto
him for righteousness. The fruit of each man's faith
will be &#7984;&#963;&#8057;&#964;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#962;&mdash;"alike precious"&mdash;when the journey
is ended. For it will be salvation in the presence of the
perfect righteousness. As in the Saviour's parable the
welcome was the same to him who had rightly used his
two talents as to him who had done the like with five,
so each faithful servant of Christ, working righteousness
according to his power here, shall be called up into the
joy of his Lord. For the joys of heaven all will not
have the same capacity; but for each, according to his
power to receive it, there will be fulness of joy. Nor
should the word "obtained" pass unnoticed. It is
the word used of Judas (Acts i. 17), who <em>obtained</em> part
of the apostolic ministry on the call of Jesus. So here,
too, the call into the faith is of God; and it is when men
obey it that they progress in Divine graces and go
forward unto righteousness.</p>

<p><em>Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge
of God and of Jesus our Lord.</em> The first words are the
same with the Apostle's prayer in the opening of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
First Epistle. And to no stage of the Christian life can
such a wish be inappropriate. To grow in grace, and so
in peace, is the Christian's daily bread; and the thought
of this seems to be uppermost in St. Peter's mind in
this letter, that thus the falling away, to which he sees
the converts are likely to be exposed, may be counteracted.
The danger was arising from the boastful
parade of a knowledge (&#947;&#957;&#8182;&#963;&#953;&#962;) falsely so called (1 Tim.
vi. 20). Before this letter was written teachers had
risen within the Church who professed to have a deeper
and more mysterious interpretation of the doctrines of
the Gospel. This esoteric enlightenment they specially
named "knowledge," and led men astray by profitless
inquiries concerning the absolute nature of God and
the manner of His communication with the world. To
this teaching St. Paul is referring when he speaks of
"foolish questions" and "endless genealogies," and it
is this which St. Peter rebukes so vehemently in the
next chapter of this letter. As an antidote for the
poison, he urges the converts to seek after a true
and full knowledge (&#7952;&#960;&#8055;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;) of the Father and the
Son. No single word can adequately represent this
term, which became the watchword of all the Christian
teachers. It is that knowledge of the truth which St.
Paul so often commends to Timothy (1 Tim. ii. 4;
2 Tim. iii. 7) and speaks of as that acknowledging of
the truth, allowing it to be effective on the life, which
follows repentance (2 Tim. ii. 25); it is specially the
knowledge of God and of things Divine; it is that
knowledge which must temper religious zeal (Rom. x.
2) that it may be effective; it is the knowledge against
which if a man sin (Heb. x. 26) he is verily reprobate.
And this true knowledge can only come of faithful
service. He shall know the Lord who loves to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
His will. Do the works, and ye shall know of the
doctrine.</p>

<p><em>Seeing that His Divine power hath granted unto us all
things that pertain unto life and godliness.</em> The work,
though great, becomes not impossible; the dangers and
difficulties, though abundant, are not insurmountable.
For it is not on us that the victory depends. God hath
begotten us again unto a lively hope through Christ's
resurrection; and Christ has promised to be with His
servants all the days, even unto the end of the world.
There is a free gift of Divine power for all our needs,
everything to foster the spiritual life and to guide into
the way of holiness. Wisdom will be given that we
may understand God's will and choose aright, strength
to persevere in the midst of trial, boldness to make
confession of the Lord before men, and watchfulness
lest we, as did the teachers of error, wax overconfident.
All things are granted; all things may be ours.</p>

<p><em>Through the knowledge of Him that called us by His
own glory and virtue.</em> Here the same full knowledge
(&#7952;&#960;&#8055;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;) of which the Apostle has just been speaking
is to become the channel of all our blessings: to know
God, who has made Himself to be known through
Christ Jesus. God's glory and virtue&mdash;that is, His
Divine power&mdash;have been manifested in Him. The
disciples beheld them in Christ's miracles. "This
beginning of His signs did Jesus, ... and manifested
His glory; and His disciples believed on Him" (John
ii. 11), and of His whole life St. John says, "We beheld
His glory, glory as of the only-begotten from the
Father. He dwelt among us full of grace and truth"
(John i. 14). This is what St. Peter means by "virtue."
And still in the hearts of men through the Spirit the
same manifestation is given. He illumines them, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
in the face of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><em>Whereby He hath granted unto us His precious and
exceeding great promises.</em> In Christ God has offered
men all the blessings of the new covenant: repentance;
faith; justification; eternal life. He, with the Son and
the Spirit, comes unto the faithful and makes His abode
with them. Thus they are made members of Christ's
mystical body. He dwells in their hearts by faith;
He gives them power to become sons of God: they are
adopted of God, who sent His only-begotten Son into
the world that they might live through Him. These
are the precious promises granted, but not forced upon
men, set forth in all their greatness in the life and love
of Jesus; and men are invited to choose them. And
the choice is made by patiently doing the will of God
so far as it is revealed to each man; after that we shall
receive the promises (Heb. x. 36).</p>

<p><em>That through these ye may become partakers of the
Divine nature.</em> This is the Divine scheme for man's
restoration; this is the change of which St. Paul
speaks to the Corinthians (2 Cor. ii. 18), and which
he illustrates by the glorified face of Moses. The
prophet was called up into Mount Horeb, and drew
near to the presence of Jehovah; the Lord spake
with him face to face out of the midst of the fire, and
his countenance was illumined by the eternal glory.
But the radiance was bestowed on Moses alone; the
people might not draw near: and the glory shed on
him was transient, so that he veiled his face lest the
people should mark its passing away. But since the
manifestation of God in Christ all men may draw near,
and be made partakers of unfading glory. It is not
with Zion as with Sinai. The way is open to all, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
will the glory pass away from those who have been
blessed with it. For now we all, with unveiled face,
reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord, and, with
progress in holiness, are transformed into the same
image, as from the Lord the Spirit. Thus men <em>become</em>&mdash;for
it is a gradual process&mdash;partakers of the Divine
nature, and being drawn more near to God while they
live here, are fitted through His mercy, when the last
call comes, to go up higher and sit down at the
marriage-supper of the Lamb, their life having been
a constant putting on of the wedding garment.</p>

<p><em>Having escaped from the corruption that is in the world
by lust.</em> This is the victory that overcometh the world,
but it is a conquest which men cannot win unaided,
nay, where the truest bravery, the surest hope, is in
speedy flight. Like Lot from Sodom must the Christian
hasten away from the lusts of the world, casting no
look behind him, nor tarrying to dally with them for
a moment. For the flesh is weak, and the prince of
this world is mighty in his evil domain, and, that he may
lead men astray, will ofttimes transform himself into
an angel of light; and within the soul of man he has
his confederate powers, the cravings of this human
nature, which thinks the baits of the enemy are pleasant
to the eyes, and it may be they look fit to make one
wise. And so in the eyes of the tempted ones, as in
the eyes of the senseless bird of the Proverbs, the net
seems spread in vain; in their own fancy they seem
able to go on without being entangled, and Satan encourages
the delusion. After that the stages are easy,
but they are all downhill. Men first walk after their
own lusts; then they are led by them, then obey them,
and at last become their slaves. This is the corruption,
the ruin, from which the Christian is aided to flee through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
seeking the glory of God as it is set before him in
the Saviour's works and words. Drawn by these, he
turns away his gaze from the world and its lusts;
his eyes no longer behold vanity to love it. He has
begun to learn of Jesus, and every new lesson makes
him stronger in the faith; and by degrees he is enabled
to bring forth into light, and bear witness to, the knowledge
which he has gained of the glory of God as
it shines in the face of Jesus Christ. So not he alone,
but those who behold his escape and mark his growth
in grace, may give God the praise, saying, "This hath
God wrought," for they shall perceive that it is His
work.</p>

<h3><em>WHO SHALL ASCEND INTO THE HILL OF THE

<blockquote>

<p>"Yea, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in

knowledge temperance; and in <em>your</em> temperance patience; and in

from his old sins. Wherefore, brethren, give the more diligence
to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye
shall never stumble: for thus shall be richly supplied unto you the
entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ."&mdash;2 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> i. 5-11.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Apostle has just set forth in all their fulness
the riches of Divine grace: the precious faith,
followed by the bestowal of all helps toward life and
godliness, and with the large promises of God to rely
on for the future, promises whereby those who seek to
renounce the things which are not of the Father, but
of the world, may become partakers of the Divine
nature. These blessings are assured, are in store, but
only for those who manifest a desire to receive them.
How this desire shall be shown, how it shall constantly
grow stronger and be ever fulfilling, until it attain
perfect fruition in Christ's eternal kingdom, is the next
instruction. <em>Yea, and for this very cause adding on</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
<em>your part all diligence, in your faith supply virtue.</em> The
plenteousness of the Divine bounty is proclaimed that
it may evoke an earnest response from all who receive
it. What shall I render unto the Lord for all the
benefits which He hath done, and is doing, unto me?
is to be the heart's cry of the feeblest of God's saints.
For the boundless ocean of grace asks that there
should be mingled with it some drops of human duty.
God will heal the bite of the serpents in the wilderness,
but to gain the blessing the wounded ones, even in
their suffering, must turn their eyes to the appointed
symbol of healing. Christ's power will cure ten lepers,
but He first sends them away to do their little in the
path of obedience: "Go, show yourselves to the
priest." Thus the Apostle's exhortation here, <em>Adding
on your part all diligence</em>. The diligence of which he
speaks is that sort of endeavour which springs from a
sense of duty: an earnest zeal and will to accomplish
whatever it finds to do; that does not linger till some
great work offers, but hastens to labour in the immediate
present. This is the spirit in which Christian
advance will be made. And the lines on which such
progress will go he now describes as though each new
step were evolved from, and were a natural development
of, that which preceded it. The faith which the
Christian holds fast is the gift of God, and it contains
the germs of every grace that can follow. These the
believer is to foster with diligence.</p>

<p>St. Peter begins his scale of graces thus: <em>In your
faith supply virtue</em>. Here virtue means the best
development of such power as a man possesses. It
may be little or great, but in its kind it is to be made
excellent. And here it is that the Christian workers
in every sphere must surpass others. They work from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
a higher motive. What they do is a constant attestation
of their faith, is done as in God's sight, and in the
confidence that in every act it is possible to give Him
glory. There can be no carelessness in such lives, for
they are filled with a sense of responsibility, which is
the first-fruit of a living faith. And in St. Peter's
figurative word the believer is said to supply each
grace in turn because he contributes by his careful
walk to wake it into life, to make it active, and let it
shine as a light before men. <em>And in your virtue knowledge</em>,
he continues. For, with duty rightly done, there
comes illumination over the path of life: men understand
more of God's dealings, and hence bring their
lives into closer harmony with His will. And we have
Christ's own assurance, "If any man willeth to do
His will, he shall know of the teaching" (John vii. 17).
And the same is true not only of the Lord's own
lessons, but of all the promptings of the Spirit in men's
hearts. If they hearken to the voice which whispers,
"This is the way," it will become at every stage plainer,
and there will be shown to them not only the how,
but the wherefore.</p>

<p><em>And in your knowledge temperance.</em> There is a
knowledge which puffeth up, giving not humility, which
is the fruit of true knowledge, but self-conceit. Of the
evil effects thereof the Apostle knew much. Out of it
grew extravagance in thought, and word, and action;
and its mischief was threatening the infant Churches.
Against it the temperance which he commends is to
be the safeguard, and it is a virtue which can be
manifested in all things. He who possesses it has
conquered himself, and has won his way thus to
stability of mind and consistency of conduct. "His
heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord," and so he can go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
forward to the Apostle's next stage of the heavenward
journey: <em>And in your temperance patience</em>. This is the
true sequence of spiritual self-control. Life is sure to
supply for the godly man trials in abundance. But he
is daily striving to die unto the world. The effort
fixes his mind firmly on the Divine purposes, and lifts
him above the circumstances of time. He is a pilgrim
and sojourner amidst them, but is in no bondage to
them, nor will he be moved, even by great afflictions,
to waver in his trust. He can look on, as seeing Him
that is invisible, and can persevere without being
unduly cast down.</p>

<p><em>And in your patience godliness.</em> The mystery of
godliness&mdash;that is, Godlikeness&mdash;was made known by
the Incarnation. The Son of God became man, that
men might through Him be made sons of God. And
godliness in the present world is Christ made manifest
in the lives of His servants. Toward this imitation of
Christ the believer will aspire through his patience.
He takes up the cross and bears it after his Master,
and thus begins his discipleship, of which the communion
with Christ waxes more intimate day by day.
Such was the godliness of St. Paul. It was because
he had followed the Lord in all that He would have
him to do that the Apostle was bold to exhort the
Corinthians, "Be ye imitators of me;" but he adds at
once, "as I am of Christ" (1 Cor. xi. 1). And when
he sends Timothy to recall his teaching to their minds
he says, "He shall put you in remembrance of my
ways which are in Christ." By such a walk with
Christ His servants are helped forward towards the
fulfilment of the two tables of the moral law, to which
St. Peter alludes in his next words: <em>And in your godliness
love of the brethren; and in your love of the brethren</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
<em>love</em>. The last-named love (&#7936;&#947;&#8049;&#960;&#951;) is that highest love,
the love of God to men, which is set up as the grand
ideal towards which His servants are constantly to
press forward; but from this the love of the brethren
cannot be severed, nay it must be made the stepping-stone
unto it. For, as another Apostle says, "he that
loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, cannot love
God, whom he hath not seen" (1 John iv. 20). But
love of the brethren is not to be narrowed in the verse
before us or elsewhere to love of those who are already
known to the Churches as brethren in the Lord. The
Gospel of Christ knows no such limits. The commission
of the Master was, "Go ye forth into all the world."
All mankind are to be won for Him; all are embraced
in the name of brethren. For if they be not so now,
it is our bounden duty to endeavour that they shall be
so. And in thus interpreting we have the mind of
Christ with us, who came to seek and to save them
that were lost, to die for the sins of the whole world,
and who found His brethren among every class who
would hear His words and obey them. We have with
us, too, the acts of God Himself, who would have all
men come to the knowledge of the truth, and who, with
impartial love, maketh His sun to rise on the evil and
on the good, and sendeth His rain upon the just and
the unjust, that thus even the evil and unjust may be
won to own His Fatherhood. Such Divine love is the
end of the commandment (1 Tim. i. 5), and terminates
the list of those graces the steps whereto St. Paul has
more briefly indicated when he says the love which is
most like God's springs from a pure heart, a good
conscience, and faith unfeigned. In this way shall men
be borne upward into the hill of the Lord.</p>

<p>The knowledge of Christ is a lesson in which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
cannot be perfected till we behold Him as He is, but
yet through it from the first we receive the earnest
and pledge of all that is meant by life and godliness,
and the culture of the Divine gifts will yield a rich
increase of the same knowledge. <em>For if these things
are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor
unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</em>
Men in this life can draw nearer unto this full knowledge,
and the bliss of each new gain prompts to more
zealous exertion. There can be no relaxation of effort,
no remissness, in such a quest. For hope is fostered
by the constant experience of a deepening knowledge,
and receives continual pledges that the glory to be
revealed is far above what is already known. The
enlightened vision grows wider and ampler; and the
path, which began in faith, shineth more and more unto
the perfect day. The world offers other lights to its
votaries, but they lead only into darkness. <em>For he that
lacketh these things is blind, seeing only what is near,
having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.</em> He
who has taken no heed to foster within him the light
which is kindled by faith, and which can only be kept
alive by the grace of the Divine Spirit, is blind, yea
blind indeed, for he is self-blinded. He has quenched
the inward light which was of God's free gift, and made
the light within him to be darkness, a darkness, like
Egypt's, which may be felt. Such a man has no insight
into the glories of the celestial vision, no joy of the
widening prospect which captivates the gaze of the
spiritual man. He can see only things close at hand,
and is as one bowed downward to the earth, groping a
dreary way, with neither hope nor exaltation at the end.
For he has forgotten&mdash;nay, St. Peter's words are stronger
and very striking&mdash;&#955;&#8053;&#952;&#951;&#957; &#955;&#945;&#946;&#8060;&#957;&mdash;he has taken hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
upon forgetfulness, made a deliberate choice of that
course which obliterates all remembrance of God's
initial gift of grace to cleanse him from his old sins.
Unmindful of this purification, he has admitted into
the dwelling where the Spirit of God would have made
a home other spirits more wicked than those first cast
out. They have entered in, and dwell there. There is
a marked contrast between this expression and the word
used for God's gift of faith (ver. 1). That a man receives
(&#955;&#945;&#967;&#8060;&#957;) as the bounty of his Lord's love; and if treasured
and used, it proves itself the light of life for this
world and the next. The wrong path he chooses for himself
(&#955;&#945;&#946;&#8060;&#957;), and its close is the blackness of the dark.</p>

<p><em>Wherefore, brethren, give the more diligence to make
your calling and election sure.</em> "Wherefore, brethren"&mdash;because
such terrible blindness as this has fallen upon
some, who left their first grace unimproved and allowed
even the memory of it to fade away&mdash;do you give the
more diligence in your religious life. The true way to
banish evil is to multiply good, leaving neither room
nor time for bad things to spread themselves. When
the peril of such things is round about you, it is no
time for relaxed effort. Your enemy never relaxes
his. He is always active, seeking whom he may
devour, and employs not the day only, but the night,
when men sleep, to sow his tares. Let him find you
ever watchful, ever diligent to hold fast and make
abundant the gifts which God has already bestowed
upon you. In the foreknowledge of the Father, you are
elect from the foundation of the world; and your call is
attested by the injunction laid upon you, "Ye shall be
holy, for I am holy." Your inheritance is in store
where nothing can assail it. God only asks that you
should manifest a wish, a longing, for His blessings; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
He will pour them richly upon you. He has made you
of a loftier mould than the inanimate and irrational
creation. The flower turns to the sun by a law which
it cannot resist. From the Sun of righteousness men
can turn away. But the Father's will is that your eyes
should be set on the hope which He offers. Then of
a certainty it will be realised. Lift up your eyes to
the eternal hills, for from thence your help will come.
The promise is sure. Strive to keep your hope equally
steadfast. For now you belong to the household of
Christ; now you are through Him children of the
heavenly Father: to this sonship you are elect and
have been called, and to it you shall attain if you hold
fast your boldness and the glorying of your hope unto
the end.</p>

<p><em>For if ye do these things, ye shall never stumble.</em> The
way will be hard, and may be long, the obstacles in
your path many and rugged, heaped up by the prince
of this world to bar you from advancing and make you
faint-hearted; but down into the midst of the danger
there shall shine from the Father of lights a ray which
shall illumine the darkness and make clear for you the
steps in which you ought to tread, and the rod and
staff of God's might will support and comfort you.</p>

<p><em>For thus shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance
into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ.</em> In his first words in this passage the Apostle
exhorted the believers to supply something, as it were,
of their own towards their spiritual advancement; but
when the demand was fully understood, behold God
had made ready the means for doing everything which
was asked for! Within the precious faith which He
bestowed was enfolded the potentiality of every other
grace. There they lay, as seeds in a seed-plot. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
that men were bidden to do was to give them culture.
Then God's Spirit would operate as the generous
sunshine, and cause each hidden power to unfold itself
in its time and bloom into beauty and strength. In
this verse the Divine assistance is more clearly promised.
What men bestow shall be returned unto them manifold.
Do your diligence, says the Apostle, and there
shall be supplied unto you from the rich stores of God
all that can help you forward in your heavenward
journey. The kingdom of God shall begin for you
while you are passing through this present life. For
it can be set up within you. It has been prepared from
all eternity in heaven, and will be enjoyed in full fruition
when this life is ended. But it is a state, and not a
place. The entrance thereto is opened here. The
believer is beckoned into it; and with enraptured soul
he enjoys through faith a foretaste of the things which
eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor heart of man
conceived, the things which God has prepared for them
that love Him. Over those joys Christ is King, but
He is also the door; and those who enter through Him
shall go in and out, and shall surely find pasture, even
life for evermore.</p>

<h3><em>THE VOICE HEARD IN THE HOLY MOUNT</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance
of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the
truth which is with <em>you</em>. And I think it right, as long as I am in this
tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; knowing
that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly, even as our Lord
Jesus Christ signified unto me. Yea, I will give diligence that at every
time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance.
For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we
made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, but we were eye-witnesses of His majesty. For He received
from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice
to Him from the excellent glory, This is My beloved Son, in whom
I am well pleased: and this voice we <em>ourselves</em> heard come out of
heaven, when we were with Him in the holy mount."&mdash;2 <span class="smcap">Peter</span>
i. 12-18.</p></blockquote>


<p>Up to this point the Apostle has spoken of God's
abundant grace and the consequent duties of
believers. And he has set forth these duties in the
most encouraging language. He has pictured first the
gift of Divine power, and the precious promises of God,
whereby men may be helped to walk onward and
upward; and when the labour is ended he has pointed
to the door of Christ's eternal kingdom, open to admit
the saint to His everlasting rest. Now he turns to
describe the duty which he feels to be laid upon himself,
and faithful is he in the discharge thereof. "Strengthen
thy brethren," is constantly ringing in his ears. <em>Wherefore</em>,
he says, <em>I shall be ready always to put you in</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
<em>remembrance of these things</em>. He dreads that taking
hold of forgetfulness&mdash;that &#955;&#8053;&#952;&#951;&#957; &#955;&#945;&#946;&#8060;&#957;&mdash;of which he
has spoken before, and against which constant diligence
is needed. So far as in him lies, the perilous condition
shall come upon none of them. The verb in the best
texts expresses far more than that which is rendered
in the Authorised Version, "I will not be negligent."
It implies a sense of duty and the intention of fulfilling
it; it bears within it, too, the thought (which is
strengthened by the word <em>always</em>) that there may be
need for such reminding, if not from internal weakness,
yet by reason of external dangers. And to bring to
the mind of the Churches the gracious bounty of God
in Christ, and to set down the steps whereby the graces
bestowed should be fostered and increased, is a subject
worthy of an Apostle, a theme which no amount of
exhortation can exhaust, and one which ought to prompt
the hearers to gratitude and obedience.</p>

<p><em>Though ye know them, and are established in the truth
which is with you.</em> Knowledge of things that pertain
unto godliness is barren unless it be wrought out in the
life. Yet knowledge and practice do not always go
hand in hand. This was one of the lessons taught by
Jesus as He washed the disciples' feet: "If ye know
these things, blessed are ye if ye do them" (John
xiii. 17). St. Peter longs that the converts should
make this blessedness their own. His life's work
is to watch for them, that they be not remiss in
doing. To none can such a duty more peculiarly
belong than to him who holds Christ's special commission
to feed the flock. By "the truth which is with
you" the Apostle appears to be alluding to the varying
degrees of advancement which there must be among
the members of the Churches. All have travelled some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
way along the road which he has shown them; all have
some of the truth within their grasp. They have set
their feet on the path, though they be planted with
different degrees of firmness. What is needed for each
and all is to press forward, not to rest in the present,
but to hasten to what lies beyond. For the truth of
God is inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, he thought, as he spake of the truth
present with them, that he was of necessity absent and
would soon be removed altogether, and the only way
by which he could serve them was by his epistle. He
could never forget that among those to whom he was
writing were the Galatians, over whose falling back
from the truth St. Paul had so greatly lamented: who
had run well, but had fainted ere the course was over;
who had received some truth to be present with them,
even the faith of the crucified Jesus, but had been
beguiled into letting it slip. Thought of these things
shapes his words as he writes, "I shall be ready <em>always</em>
to put you in remembrance." He rejoices that they are
"established," but yet sends them an admonition. Let
him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.</p>

<p><em>And I think it right.</em> The word marks the solemn
estimate which the Apostle takes of his duty. It is a
just and righteous work. Danger is abroad, and he
has been made one of Christ's shepherds. Many
motives prompt him to write his words of counsel and
warning. First, his love for them as his brethren, some
of them, perhaps, his children in Christ. Like St. Paul,
he has them in his heart. Then, he will fulfil to the
utmost the charge which the Lord gave him. He is
conscious, too, that opportunities for the fulfilment of
his trust will soon come to an end. <em>As long as I am
in this tabernacle</em>, he says. It is but a frail home, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
body; and with St. Peter age was drawing on. He
saw that the time of his departure could not be far off,
and this left no excuse for remitting his admonitions.
He must be urgent so long as he can. <em>To stir you up
by putting you in remembrance.</em> The work of the
Apostle will be thoroughly done (&#948;&#953;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#8055;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#957;), and be of
that nature for which the Holy Ghost was promised to
himself and his fellows. "He shall bring to your remembrance
all that I said unto you" (John xiv. 26).
Thus would St. Peter, like St. Paul, impart unto the
converts some spiritual gift, that he, with them, may be
comforted, strengthened, each by the other's faith. So
he proceeds to dwell on that Divine manifestation by
which his own belief had been confirmed. And there
would be memories of St. Paul's lessons also to call to
their minds, and many of these would be awakened by
an appeal like this. The falling away of the Galatians
had been from a different cause, but the memory of the
past would warn, and might strengthen, them all in the
future against their new dangers.</p>

<p><em>Knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh
swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified unto me.</em>
Such a motive makes the appeal most touching. He
will soon be removed. To this he looks forward without
alarm. His concern is for them, not for himself.
He regards his death as the stripping off of a dress:
when its use is past it is parted with without regret.
To him, as to his brother Apostle, to die would be
gain. But he must have had constantly in mind the
Master's prophecy, "When thou art old, thou shalt
stretch forth thine hands, and another shall gird thee
and carry thee whither thou wouldest not" (John xxi.
18). And in the word "swiftly" he no doubt alludes,
not only to the old age in which the end would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
naturally come, but also to some sharp stroke by which
his departure would be brought to pass. The stretching
out of his hands would be a preliminary to the
prison and the cross. In the Gospel it is said that
Christ's words give the sign (&#963;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#8055;&#957;&#969;&#957;), the indication,
by what death he should die. The Apostle employs a
stronger word (&#7952;&#948;&#8053;&#955;&#969;&#963;&#949;) here: "made it evident." The
English version renders both verbs by "signify," but
St. Peter's own expression marks how growing age had
made clearer to him the manner in which his death
should be accomplished. And the mention of Jesus
brings vividly before him the thought of the scene he
is about to describe, so vividly that some of the language
of the Transfiguration scene is reproduced by
him.</p>

<p><em>Yea, I will give diligence that at every time ye may be
able after my decease to call these things to remembrance.</em>
Jesus is related (Luke ix. 31) to have conversed with
Moses and Elias of His decease (&#7956;&#958;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#962;) which He
should accomplish at Jerusalem. The word is rare in
this sense, being commonly used, as in Heb. xi. 22, of
the <em>departing</em> of the children of Israel from Egypt.
But it is deeply printed in St. Peter's mind; and he,
who looks forward to drinking of his Master's cup and
dying somewhere as He died, employs the same word
concerning his own end. And the word is another
indication of the calm with which he can look forward
to his death. As with Christ, there is no reluctance,
no shrinking. The change will be but a departure, a
passing from one stage to another, the putting off the
worn garment of mortality to be clothed upon by the
robe which is from heaven.</p>

<p>His letters are the only means whereby he can
speak after he has been taken from them. Hence his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
earnestness in writing. "I will give diligence." I have
urged diligence on you; I will apply the lesson to
myself, and make it possible that afterwards on every
occasion you may have it before you. When dead, he
will yet speak to them; so that in each new trial, in
each time of need, they may strengthen their faith or
be warned of their danger. "At every time," he says;
and thus his strengthening words of admonition are a
legacy through the ages to the Church for evermore.</p>

<p><em>For we did not follow cunningly devised fables.</em> Here
the Apostle speaks in the plural number, and it may
well be that he means to include St. Paul with himself
and James and John. For the evidence which converted
that Apostle, though not the same as that
vouchsafed to St. Peter, was of the same kind. The
Lord had appeared unto him in the way, had made
His glory seen and felt, and fixed for ever in the
Apostle's heart the reality of His power and presence.
His cry, "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?"
came from a heart conquered and convinced. He too
followed no cunningly devised fable.</p>

<p>By the word (&#963;&#949;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#953;) which is rendered
"cunningly devised" we are reminded of the (&#963;&#959;&#966;&#8055;&#945;)
wisdom which St. Paul so earnestly disclaims in his
first letter to the Corinthians. "I came not with
excellency of speech or of <em>wisdom</em>," he says; "my
preaching was not in persuasive words of <em>wisdom</em>, that
your faith should not stand in the <em>wisdom</em> of men, but
in the power of God." The <em>wisdmom</em> which he speaks
is not of this world, but God's <em>wisdom</em> in a mystery
(1 Cor. ii. 1-7). St. Paul also warns against giving
"heed to fables, which minister questionings rather
than a dispensation of God which is in faith" (1 Tim.
i. 4; cf. also iv. 7 and 2 Tim. iv. 4). In another place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
(Titus i. 14) he calls them "Jewish fables," a name
which is of the same import as the "Jewish vanities"
of Ignatius,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> a name by which he intimates that they
darken and confuse the mind. The legends of the
Talmud, the subtleties of the rabbinical teaching, and
the allegorising interpretations of Philo are the delusions
to which both the Apostles refer. The evidence
on which they ask credence for their teaching is of
another kind. "That which was from the beginning,"
is the testimony of another Apostle, "that which we
heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that
which we beheld, and our hands handled, concerning
the word of life, ... that declare we unto you also,
that ye also may have fellowship with us" (1 John i.
1-3). St. Peter had seen, and so had St. Paul; and
they constantly appealed to, and rested their teaching
on, facts and the historic reality of Christ's life and
work.</p>

<p><em>When we made known unto you the power and coming
of our Lord Jesus Christ.</em> This is the contrast to that
mythic and allegorical teaching to which he has just
alluded. From it men could derive neither help in the
present, nor hope for the future. It generated superstition,
and its followers believed a lie. Often it denied
the continuity of revelation, and cast aside all the
records thereof. Like theosophic dreams in every age,
it was always unprofitable, nearly always pernicious.
On the other hand, the teaching of Christ's Apostles
proclaimed a power which could save men from their
sins, and imparted a hope that stretched out beyond
the present, looking for the time when the Lord would
reappear. All power is given unto Christ. He is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Redeemer and Lord, and is to be at last the Judge of
men. The assurance of His coming had been proclaimed
by St. Peter in his former letter as a consolation
under affliction. Faith, tried by suffering, will be
found unto praise, and glory, and honour at the revelation
of Jesus Christ (1 Peter i. 7). This is the climax
of the glad tidings of the Gospel. But Christ comes
to His people through all the days; and they are
conscious of His coming, and inspired thereby and
enabled for their work.</p>

<p><em>But we were eye-witnesses of His majesty.</em> He has
already (1 Peter iii. 22) spoken of the fact of Christ's
ascension; he is now about to describe what was
seen on the holy mount. These things are facts and
verities, and not fables. But yet there was more
revealed in them than either eye could grasp, or tongue
could tell. They were God's truth in a mystery, which
supplied new thought for a whole life-time. So for
"eye-witnesses" the Apostle uses a word akin to that
which twice over he employs in the former Epistle
(ii. 12; iii. 2) to describe the effect which Christian
lives, when fully scanned, shall have upon the
unbeliever. They shall have power to stop the mouths
of opponents and to win them to the faith which before
they maligned. Such deep insight into the power, and
work, and glory of Jesus was imparted to the Apostles
at the Transfiguration. They were initiated into the
wisdom of God, and henceforth became prophets of the
Incarnation; they were convinced that the Jesus with
whom they companied was very God manifest in the
flesh. The voice from heaven proclaimed it; it was
attested by the glorified presence of Moses and Elijah,
and by the majesty which for a moment broke through
the veil of Christ's flesh. Later on they saw Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
risen from the dead, beheld His ascension into glory,
and heard from the angels the promise of His return.
Not without much meaning does the Apostle use a
special pronoun (&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#957;&#959;&#965;) as he dwells on this scene of
His majesty. For he would impress on his converts
the identity of that Jesus whom he had known in the
flesh with the very Son of God sent down from heaven.</p>

<p><em>For He received from God the Father honour and
glory.</em> For the bright cloud which overshadowed them
on the mountain-top was the visible token of the
presence of God, as of old the cloud of glory had been,
where God dwelt above the cherubim; while the
honour and glory of Jesus were manifested when He
was proclaimed to be the very Son of God. <em>When
there came such a voice to Him from the excellent glory,
This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</em>
To express the magnificence of the glory which he
beheld, the Apostle uses a word not found elsewhere
in the New Testament. The Septuagint has it to
describe the splendour of Jeshurun's God, who rideth
in His <em>excellency</em> on the skies (Deut. xxxiii. 26). And
it is this outward brightness of the shroud of the Godhead
which tells all that human powers can receive
of the majesty which it hides, just as His palace, the
heavens, declares constantly the glory of God.</p>

<p>The words spoken by the heavenly voice vary here
from the records of each of the three Gospels. In
one case the variation is slight, but there is no
precise agreement. Had the Epistle been the work
of some forger of a later age than St. Peter's, we may
rest assured that there would have been complete
accord with one Evangelist or the other. There is
a like diversity in the records of the words of the
inscription above Christ's cross. Substantial truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
not verbal preciseness, is what the Evangelists sought
to leave to the Church; and their fidelity is proved by
nothing more powerfully than by the diverse features
of the Gospel narratives.</p>

<p><em>And this voice we ourselves heard come out of heaven,
when we were with Him in the holy mount.</em> We learn
here why the Apostles were taken with Jesus to witness
His transfiguration. Just before that event we find
(Matt. xvi. 21; Mark viii. 31; Luke ix. 22) it recorded
by each of the Synoptists that Jesus had begun to
show unto His disciples how He must suffer and die
at Jerusalem. To Peter, who, as at other times, was
the mouthpiece of the rest, such a declaration was
unacceptable; but at his expression of displeasure he
met the rebuke, "Get thee behind Me, Satan." He,
and the rest with him, felt no doubt that such a death
as Jesus had spoken of would be, humanly speaking,
the ruin of their hopes. What these hopes were they
did not formulate, but we can learn their character
from some of their questionings. Now, on the top of
Tabor, these three representatives of the apostolic
band behold Moses and Elias appearing in glory, and
Christ glorified more than they; and the subject of
which they spake was the very death of which they had
so disliked to hear: the decease which He was about
to accomplish (&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#957;) in Jerusalem (Luke ix. 31).
The verb which the Evangelist uses tells of the fulfilment
of a prescribed course, and thus St. Peter was
taught, and the rest with him, to speak of that death
afterwards as he does in his former letter. "Christ
was verily foreordained" to this redeeming work
"before the foundation of the world." They heard
that He who was to die was the very Son of God.
The voice came from the glory of heaven; and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
henceforth their hearts were still, even Peter's voice
being less heard than before. Down from the mountain
they brought much illumination, much solemn pondering.
We can feel why it was that "they held their
peace, and told no man in those days any of the
things which they had seen"; we can feel, too, that
from henceforth the scene of this vision would be the
holy mount. God's voice had been heard there attesting
the Divinity of their Lord and Master; the place
whereon they had thus stood was for evermore holy
ground.</p>

<h3><em>THE LAMP SHINING IN A DARK PLACE</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"And we have the word of prophecy <em>made</em> more sure; whereunto
ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp shining in a dark place,
until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts: knowing
this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation.
For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from
God, being moved by the Holy Ghost."&mdash;2 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> i. 19-21.</p></blockquote>


<p>The rendering of the first words in this passage
must be reckoned among the distinct improvements
of the Revised Version. As the translation stands in
the Authorised Version, "We have also a more sure
word of prophecy," it conveys a sense which many must
have found perplexing. The Apostle had just dwelt
on the confirmation of faith, both for himself and those
to whom he preached, which was ministered by the
vision of the glory of Jesus and by the proclamation
of His Divinity by God's voice from heaven. Could
any prophetic message vie in his estimate with the
assurance of such a revelation? Now what St. Peter
meant is made clear. <em>And we have the word of prophecy
made more sure</em>&mdash;more sure because we have received
the confirmation of all that the prophets spake dimly
and in figure. The Apostle and the rest of the Jewish
people had been trained in the ancient Scriptures, and
gathered from them, some more and some less, light
concerning God's scheme of salvation. There were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
however, but few who had attained a true insight into
what was revealed. They had dwelt, as a rule, too
exclusively on all that spake of the glory of the promised
Redeemer and of His coming to reign and to conquer.
That there should be suffering in His life, they had
put out of sight, though the prophets had foretold it;
and so when Christ spake of His crucifixion, soon to
come to pass in Jerusalem, St. Peter exclaimed&mdash;and
he had the feelings of his nation with him&mdash;"That be
far from Thee." The voice on the holy mount and the
words of Moses and Elias had opened their eyes to the
full drift of prophetic revelation; and by the illumination
of that scene of glory, where yet the lot of suffering
was contemplated as near at hand, there had been given
to them a grasp of the whole scope of prophecy, and
their partial and distorted conception of the work of
Christ was banished for ever.</p>

<p><em>Whereunto ye do well that ye take heed.</em> The idea
of a volume of New Testament Scriptures had not
entered St. Peter's mind. He knows that St. Paul's
letters (iii. 15, 16) are read by some, who do not all
profit by the privilege; and his own letters he intends
to be an abiding admonition to the Churches. The
need, too, of a record of Christ's life and works, a
gospel, must have begun to be felt. But yet he points
the converts to the ancient records of Israel as a guide
to direct their lives. They had heard the Gospel story
from the lips of himself and others. Thus they had the
key to unlock what hitherto had seemed hard to understand,
and could study their prophetic volume with
a new and perfect light. This he means by "ye do
well." Ye go to the true source of guidance, drink
of the fountain of true wisdom, and gain strength and
refreshment when it is much needed. Duly to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
heed of these records is to search out their lessons and
labour after that deeper sense which is enshrined
beneath the word. Given as they were at various
times and in various fashions, and given to point on to
God's purposes in the future, these Scriptures must
needs have been dark to those who first received them,
nor could the men whom God chose to deliver them
have been fully conscious of all they were meant to
declare as the ages rolled on and brought their fulfilment
nearer. Nor are they all luminous even yet, but they
grow ever more so to those who take heed.</p>

<p><em>As unto a lamp shining in a dark place.</em> Spite of
all the light we can compass, the world will always be
in one sense a dark place. It is a world of beauty, full
of the tokens of God's handiwork, the indications of
His love. But evil has also made an entrance; and
the trail of the serpent is evident in the sorrow, the
disease, the wickedness, that abound on every side.
And problems continually present themselves which
even to the saints are hard to be solved. Many a
psalm records the conflict which has to be passed
through ere God's ways can be reconciled to men.
We must go into His house, draw near to Him, feel
to the full His Fatherhood, ere our hearts can be contented.
Nay, the disquiet breaks out again and again.
So God, in His mercy, has provided His lamp for those
who will use it; and to those who take heed it furnishes
ever new light. The history, the prophecy, the devotion,
the allegory, of the holy volume are all full of illustrations
of the firm purpose of redemption, of the eternal,
unchanging love of Jehovah, thwarted only by the
perverseness of those whom He is longing to save
from their sins. And to call God's revelation in His
word a lamp is a striking and instructive figure. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
is something which you can take with you, and carry
into the dark places whither your lot may send you,
and use its light just where and when you need it.
But its light must be fed by the constant oil of diligent
study, or its usefulness will not be found to the full.</p>

<p>And the truth is the same if we apply the lesson to
nations and Churches as it is for individuals. The
records were given to a nation chosen to keep the
knowledge of God alive in the world. The word spoken
did not profit, as it was meant to do, because it was
not mixed with faith in them that heard it. And there
is the same faith needed still. The light of a lamp
in a dark place shines but a little way; but by the
rays of the Divine lamp men are to walk, in faith that
the steps beyond will become clear in their turn. And
thus alone will the problems of life be really solved,
the religious contentions, the social difficulties, the
trials of family life, the individual doubts and fears:
all are elements of darkness; all need to be illumined
by the lamp which God has provided. Oh that men
would burnish it by diligent heed, and keep its radiance
at the full by constant seeking thereunto!</p>

<p><em>Until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your
hearts.</em> The day has begun to dawn for those who
will lift up their heads to its breaking. The day-star
from on high hath visited the earth in the person of
Christ, but the full day will not be till He returns again.
Yet His coming into the world was meant to lighten
every man, and to win all men to walk in His light.
"I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto Me," is
His own promise. And in that decease of which He
spake with Moses and Elijah He has been lifted up.
But He has left it to them that love Him to lift Him
up constantly before the eyes of men, to exalt Him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
their lives; and our lax performances make the progress
of His <em>drawing all men</em>, to halt. We fail to make due use
of the lamp which He has put ready to our hand, and
which only needs to be grasped. The perfect day will
not come to us in this life, but He gives to His faithful
ones glimpses of the dawn. They learn the presence
of the Sun of righteousness, though as yet they see
Him only through the mists and darkness of life; and
they are cheered with the certainty of the coming day.
And the daystar of the Spirit is kindled in the hearts
of those who ask Him to dwell there; and they are led
forward into greater and greater truth, into richer and
fuller light. And for the same end the Spirit is promised
to the Church of Christ: that she may be enabled
having used the lamp first given with all faithfulness,
to open to men the ways of God more fully, and, amid
the changes of times and varying vicissitudes and needs
of men and nations, to prove that the only satisfaction
to the soul is the increasing knowledge of the oneness
of God's purpose and eternity of His love. To such
a power she will be helped by giving heed to the lamp
in every dark place and seeking in its light the
elucidation of all hard questions.</p>

<p><em>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of
private interpretation.</em> The Greek words need to be
taken account of before we can gather the true meaning
of this clause. That which is translated "is" is much
more frequently rendered "comes to pass," and bears
the sense of "arises," "has its origin." "Interpretation"
is the translation of a word which occurs here
only in the New Testament, and implies the "loosing"
of what is complicated, the "clearing" of what is
obscure. The lesson which the Apostle would give
relates to the right appreciation of the Old Testament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Scriptures, which contain the prophecy which he has
called above "the lamp in a dark place." He intends
to say something which may incline men to follow its
guidance. The prophetic writings furnish us with
illustrations how the problems which arose in the lives
of the men of old time, both about events around them
and also about the dispensations of Divine providence,
found their solution. Thus they furnish rules and
principles for time to come; and that men may be
induced to confide in their guidance is the object of
St. Peter's words. He bids the converts know that
these unravellings and clearings of the ways of God
are not men's private interpretation of what they beheld.
This was not the manner in which they came
to be known. They are not evolved out of human
consciousness, pondering on the facts of life and the
ways of God, nor are they the individual exposition
of those whom God employed as His prophets. They
are messages and lessons which came from one and
the same impelling power, from one and the same
illuminating influence, even from God Himself, and
so are uniform in spirit and teaching from first to last;
and He from whom and through whom they are given
can say by the mouth of the last of the prophetic body,
"I am Jehovah; I change not" (Mal. iii. 6).</p>

<p>Although the Apostle uses in this Epistle the word
"Scriptures" (iii. 16) for the writings of New Testament
teachers, it is not likely that he in mind included
them among the prophetic Scriptures of which he here
speaks. We, knowing the flood of light which the
Gospels and Epistles pour upon the Old Testament,
can now apply his words to them, fully perceiving that
they are a true continuation of the Divine enlightenment,
another spring from the same heavenly fountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who would explain "interpretation" as the
judgement which men now exercise in the study and
application of the words of Scripture forget the force
of the verb (&#947;&#8055;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;) "comes to pass," and that the
Apostle is exalting the source and origin of the words
of prophecy, that he may the more enforce his lesson,
"Ye do well to take heed to them."</p>

<p><em>For no prophecy ever came by the will of man.</em> Prophecy
makes known what never could have entered
into the mind or understanding of men, nor were the
prophetic words that have come down to us written
because men wished to publish views and imaginations
of their own. Man is not the source of prophecy.
That lay above and beyond the human penmen. Nay,
men could not, had they so willed, have spoken of the
things there written for the enlightenment of the ages.
These are deep things, belonging to the foreknowledge
of God alone, by whom His Son was foreknown as the
Lamb without spot before the foundation of the world.
Of this the book of prophecy tells from first to last:
of the seed of the woman to bruise the serpent's head;
of the family from which a seed should come in whom
all the earth should be blessed; of the rod to spring
from the stem of Jesse; of the king who was to rule in
righteousness; of the time when the kingdom of the
Lord's house should be established on the top of the
mountains, and all nations should flow into it; of the day
when all men should know the Lord from the least to
the greatest, when the earth should be full of the knowledge
of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. Such
tidings came not into the thoughts of men except as
they were put there from the Lord; and they tell of
things yet to come that are beyond the grasp of men
unless they be spiritually-minded and enlightened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
For not only are the prophetic Scriptures God's special
gift: the insight into their full meaning comes also from
Him. Beyond the physical sense it is true, "The
hearing ear and the seeing eye, the Lord is the Maker
of them both" (Prov. xx. 12).</p>

<p><em>But men spake from God, being moved by the Holy
Ghost.</em> The Authorised Version translates a text
which had, "<em>Holy</em> men of God spake as they were
moved by the <em>Holy</em> Ghost." And this repetition of an
adjective is after St. Peter's manner, though the oldest
manuscripts do not support it here. Compare the thrice-repeated
"righteous" in the notice of Lot in the next
chapter (ii. 7, 8). And the Authorised Version describes
most truly the agents whom God chooses. He
will have none but holy men to be the heralds of His
truth. A Caiaphas may be constrained to utter His
counsels, but as His prophets God takes the holy
among men. These can grasp more of His teaching,
and we receive more than we should through other
channels. By their zeal for holiness they are brought
nearer unto God, and made more receptive of the
teaching of the Spirit, who Himself is holy. But "men
spake from God" conveys a true idea of prophecy.
Even one who was not holy could feel that the power
given to him was not his own, nor could he speak after
his own will. "What the Lord saith unto me, that must
I speak," was the confession of Balaam, though his
greed for gain prompted him to the opposite. And
there are many expressions in the Old Testament
which bear witness to the effective operation of God's
power, as when we read of the Spirit of the Lord
coming mightily upon those whom He had chosen to
do His bidding. And the same lesson is to be found
in St. Peter's words here. "Being moved" is literally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
"being carried." An impulse was given to them, and
a power which was above their own. This is betokened,
too, when the Old Testament prophets tell how the
Spirit of the Lord carried them to this place or that,
where a revelation was to be imparted which they
should publish in His name. Thus were they moved
by the Holy Ghost, and thus were they able to speak
from God.</p>

<p>Such is St. Peter's lesson on the nature and office
of prophecy. It is an illumination to which men could
not have attained by any wisdom of their own, nay
could not have framed the wish to attain unto it. For
it lay hid among God's mysteries. It is imparted from
the holy God to holy men, as His mediators to the less
spiritual in the world; it has received abundant confirmation
through the incarnation of the Son of God,
but yet it has many a lesson for mankind to ponder
and seek to comprehend. It is their wisdom who
follow its guidance and bear it with them as a lamp
amid the dispensations of Providence, which still are
not all clear, and amid the darkness which will often
surround them while they live here. That men may
be prompted to its use, God is a God that hideth
Himself, yet through it He will lead those who follow
its light along the road to immortality.</p>

<h3><em>THE LORD KNOWETH HOW TO DELIVER</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"But there arose false prophets also among the people, as among
you also there shall be false teachers, who shall privily bring in
destructive heresies, denying even the Master that bought them,
bringing upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow
their lascivious doings; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall
be evil spoken of. And in covetousness shall they with feigned
words make merchandise of you: whose sentence now from of old
lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not. For if God
spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, and
committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgement;
and spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven
others, a preacher of righteousness, when He brought a flood upon
the world of the ungodly; and turning the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having
made them an example unto those that should live ungodly; and
delivered righteous Lot, sore distressed by the lascivious life of the
wicked (for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and
hearing, vexed <em>his</em> righteous soul from day to day with <em>their</em> lawless
deeds): the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation,
and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of
judgement."&mdash;2 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> ii. 1-9.</p></blockquote>


<p>This second chapter contains much more of a direct
description of the heretical teaching and practices
from which the converts were in danger, and is full
of warning and comfort, both alike drawn from that
Old Testament prophecy to the light of which St. Peter
has just been urging them to take heed. The chapter
has many features and much of its language in common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
with the Epistle of St. Jude. But the opening of the
chapter seems a suitable place to call attention to a
difference of motive which is manifested in this Epistle
and in that. They resemble one another greatly in
the illustrations which they have in common, but St.
Peter makes a twofold use of them: while showing
that the ungodly will assuredly be punished, he comforts
the righteous with the lesson that, be they ever
so few, even as the eight who were saved at the Deluge,
or as Lot, with his diminished family, at the overthrow
of Sodom, the Lord knows how to deliver His servants
out of trials. Of this latter side of the prophetic picture
St. Jude shows us nothing. The evil-doings of the
tempters must have waxed grosser in his day, and he
is only concerned to preach the certainty of their condemnation.
The unbelievers in the wilderness, the
angels who sinned, the Cities of the Plain, the error
of Balaam, and the overthrow of Korah are all cited
in proof that the wicked shall not escape; but he has
no word about the deliverance of those whose souls are
tortured by the wicked doings of the sinners among
whom it is their lot to live.</p>

<p><em>But there arose false prophets also among the people,
as among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall
privily bring in destructive heresies, denying even the
Master that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift
destruction.</em> It is as though the Apostle would say, Be
not unduly dismayed. The lamp of Old Testament
prophecy shows that yours is a lot which has befallen
others. As Israel of old was God's people, so the
Church of Christ is now. And among them again and
again false prophets arose, not only those of Baal and
Asherah, not only those who served the calves at Dan
and Bethel, but those who called themselves by Jehovah's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
name, and of whom He says to Jeremiah, "The
prophets prophesy lies in My name; I sent them not,
neither have I commanded them, neither spake I unto
them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and
divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their
heart" (Jer. xiv. 14). The picture is exactly repeated
for these Asian Churches. False teaching had attached
itself to the true, used its language, and professed to be
at one with it, except in so far as it was superior. For
the history of corruptions in the faith repeats itself,
and&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Wherever God erects a house of prayer,</div>
<div class="line">The devil always builds a chapel there."</div>
</div></div>

<p>It is the most perilous aspect of error when it parades
itself as the truest truth. Hence the name by which
St. Peter calls this dangerous teaching: "destructive
heresies." They beguile unstable souls to their ruin.
Their exponents choose the name of Christ to call themselves
by, but cast aside the doctrine of the Cross both
in its discipline for their lives, and as the altar of human
redemption. And the men to whom St. Peter alludes
were either among the teachers, or put themselves
forward to teach; and there was a danger lest their
authority should be recognised. They accepted Christ,
but not as He loves to be accepted. He has called
Himself Lord and Master, and has paid the price which
makes Him so; but by their interpretations both of
His nature and His office these men in very deed
renounced and deserted His service, ignored their
relation as His bondservants, and in this way denied
the Master that bought them. Soon they chose other
masters and became the slaves of the world and the
flesh. Thus they entered on the path that leads to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
destruction, and soon it will come upon them. They
who destroyed others shall themselves be destroyed.
The lords whom they serve have all their empire in
this life; and when the end thereof comes, it comes all
too soon, and is a dread overthrow of everything they
have set store by. On their lot the lamp of prophecy
sheds its light: "How suddenly do they perish and
come to a fearful end."</p>

<p><em>And many shall follow their lascivious doings; by
reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken
of.</em> St. Jude, who had seen the results of such teaching,
says these men turned the very grace of God into
lasciviousness; they perverted the teachings of the
Gospel concerning the freedom which is in Christ, and
their phraseology they made to have a Pauline ring
about it. Did he not teach how Christ had made men
free? Had they not heard from him that men should
cast off trust in the bondage of the Law? In this wise
they taught a doctrine of lawless self-indulgence, which
they extolled as the token of entire emancipation and
of a loftier nature on which the taint of sins could
leave no defilement. In the blindness of their hearts,
self-chosen blindness, of which they boasted as knowledge,
they gave themselves over to the flesh, to work
all uncleanness with greediness.</p>

<p>St. Peter knows that baits of this sort appeal to the
natural man; that there is within the citadel of the
heart a traitorous weakness which is ready to betray it
to the enemy. So, with prophetic foresight, he laments,
Many shall follow after them. And such sinners do
not sin unto themselves: their falling away brings
calamity on the whole Church of Christ. It did so
then; it does so still. The faithful cannot escape from
the obloquy which is due to the faithless; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
world, which cares little for Christ, will readily point
to the evil lives which it sees in the renegade
brethren, and draw the conclusion that in secret the
rest run to the same excess of riot. Evil-speaking of
this kind became abundantly common in the first
Christian centuries, and furnishes the object of many
Christian apologies.</p>

<p><em>And in covetousness shall they with feigned words make
merchandise of you.</em> St. Paul in writing to Timothy
gives a comment which throws much light on these
words. He tells of men who consent not to sound
words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, thus
denying the Master that bought them. He speaks of
them as bereft of the truth, supposing that godliness
is a way of gain; and he adds, "They that desire to
be rich fall into a temptation and a snare, and many
foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction
and perdition. For the love of money is a root of
all kinds of evil, which some reaching after have been
led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves
through with many sorrows" (1 Tim. vi. 3-10). From
the first days of the Church's history we see, from the
instances of Ananias and Sapphira, and of Simon, with
his offer of money to the Apostles, that both among
the disciples and the would-be teachers covetousness
made itself very apparent. The communistic basis on
which the society was constituted lent itself to the
schemes of those who desired to make a gain of their
Christian profession. In the time when St. Peter
wrote the evil had spread. Teachers were discovering
that, by a modification or adaptation of the Christian
language and doctrines, they could draw after them
many followers. These were the feigned words to
which the Apostle alludes, and the contributions of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
satisfied hearers were proving a gainful merchandise.
The Gnostic teachers were of various sorts, but of all
alike the language was boastful as coming of superior
insight; great, swelling words they spake, having men's
persons in regard because of the prospects of advantage.
The evil was a sore one, and is so wherever
it finds entry. And later ages have also known somewhat
of its mischief. It is the wisdom of all Christian
communities so to order themselves that their teachers
and guides may be safe from this temptation. For
such teachers do not stop at small beginnings of error,
but prophesy smooth things, and close their eyes at
evil; nay, in this case they seem to have encouraged
sensual living, as though it were an indication of the
freedom of which they boasted.</p>

<p><em>Whose sentence now from of old lingereth not, and
their destruction slumbereth not.</em> In thought the
Apostle reads the book of prophecy. It is as if he
said, "It is written in the prophetic word." And
when the overthrow of the sinners comes to pass,
those who behold it may say, "Thus is the prophecy
fulfilled." The doom of such sinners is sure. They
may seem to live their lives with impunity for a while,
as though God's eternal law were inoperative; but
the issue is certain. None such escape. God's mills
grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small. And
the lot of such men is destruction. Of illustrations
the Apostle chooses three, applying each to a different
vice of these teachers of error. These men were
proud; so were the angels that sinned, but their pride
was only a prelude to their fall. These men were
disobedient; so were the antediluvian sinners, and
would neither hearken nor turn, and so the Flood came
and swept them all away. These men were sensual;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
so were the dwellers in the Cities of the Plain, and
their overthrow remains still a memorial of God's wrath
against such sinners. Verily the sentence of all such
men is written from of old.</p>

<p><em>For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but
cast them down to hell, and committed them to pits of
darkness, to be reserved unto judgement.</em> To each of the
three instances which St. Peter adduces the reader
is left to supply the unmistakable conclusion, "Neither
will He spare the sinners of to-day." The sentences
are all the more solemn from their incompleteness.
Some have thought that the reference in this verse is
to the narrative found in Gen. vi. 3; but that
account is very full of difficulties, and there is no
mention of a judgement upon those who offended. It
seems more sound exposition to take the Apostle's
words as spoken of him concerning whom Christ has
told us (John viii. 44) that he was a murderer from
the beginning and stood not in the truth, and of the
condemnation of whose pride St. Paul speaks to Timothy
(1 Tim. iii. 6). For him and for his fellow-sinners
the Gospel teaches us (Matt. xxv. 41) that eternal fire
was prepared, and an apostle (James ii. 19) says that
"the devils believe and shudder," it must be in apprehension
of a coming judgement. All that St. Peter here
says is implied in these Scriptural allusions to Satan
and his fall; and it is more prudent to apply to them
the highly figurative language of the Apostle here,
which is exactly after his manner, than to seek for
fanciful interpretations of the Mosaic story. We may
rest assured by the way in which these things are
spoken of, though but dimly, by Christ and His
Apostles, that they formed a portion of Jewish religious
teaching and constituted part of the faith of St. Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and his contemporaries, though there is but little
mention of the fallen angels in the Old Testament.</p>

<p><em>And spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah
with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when He
brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly.</em> Here
the Apostle points to a consolation for the converts
amid their trials. The ungodly do not escape, be
their multitude ever so great. A world full of sinners
is involved in one common overthrow. Nor are the
righteous forgotten, though their number be but few.
The lamp of prophecy sheds much light here. Amid
all God's dispensations toward Israel, His faithful ones
were the remnant only; but these were saved by the
grace of the Lord, they were brought out from the
destruction, and not forsaken, and had a promise that
they should take root downward and bear fruit upward.
The words in which St. Peter describes the chief
person of the few saved in the Deluge appear intended
to point out that feature in Noah's history which most
resembled the lot of the Asian Churches. They were
now, as he was of old, God's heralds in the midst of
a naughty world; and to bring to their minds the
thought of his long-sustained opposition and mockery
could hardly fail to nerve them to stand fast. What
lot could be more desperate than the Patriarch's? For
a hundred and twenty years by action and by word
he published his message, and it fell on deaf ears;
yet God was guarding him (&#7952;&#966;&#8059;&#955;&#945;&#958;&#949;&#957;) through it all,
and words could not express more complete safety
than when the early record tells us, ere the Flood came,
"The Lord shut him in."</p>

<p><em>And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into
ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having made
them an example unto those that should live ungodly.</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
These cities stood in a land fair enough to be likened
to the garden of the Lord. To Lot himself their fertile
fields had been a temptation, and by yielding thereto
he brought on himself a plenitude of sorrow; and the
sacred record counts his deliverance rather to the faith
and righteousness of Abraham than to himself. God
remembered Abraham, and brought Lot out of the
overthrow. One of the fairest parts of His world God
condemned for the wickedness of them that inhabited
it. Nature was defaced for man's sin, and still lies
desolate as a perpetual homily against such ungodly
living as often comes of wealth and fulness of bread.
After such a state were these false teachers seeking
while they made their gain of their disciples; and in
the later times of which St. Jude speaks, having fostered
all that was carnal within and around them, in those
things which they understood naturally, there they
cast themselves away.</p>

<p><em>And delivered righteous Lot, sore distressed by the
lascivious life of the wicked (for that righteous man
dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his
righteous soul from day to day with their lawless deeds).</em>
The thrice-named righteousness of Lot is perhaps thus
set down because of the struggle which it must have
been to maintain the fear of Abraham's God among
such sinful surroundings. Lot was in the land of the
enemy, and his deliverance is pictured as a very rescue:
he was saved, yet so as by fire. He had gone down
into the plain with thoughts of a life of abundance,
and it may be of ease, a contrast to the wandering life
which he had hitherto shared with Abraham. Instead
of this he found anguish and distress of mind, which
no amount of temporal prosperity could alleviate; and
to this would be added self-reproach. It was of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
own choice that he was dwelling among them. The
Apostle paints his misery in the strongest terms. He
was distressed; and of the sights and sounds on every
side, and never ceasing, he made a torture to his soul.
It was no mere offence to him that these things were
so: it was very anguish to see men setting at defiance
every law human and Divine. To behold the evils of
a lascivious life waxing rampant in the midst of the
Christian Churches, and countenanced by those who
assumed the office of teachers, must have been an
agony to the faithful akin to that with which Lot
tortured himself. St. Peter would strengthen the
drooping hearts of the brethren; and no greater comfort
could there be found than this which he offers, taking
the lamp of prophecy and shedding its rays of hope
into the dark places of their lives.</p>

<p><em>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of
temptation.</em> Already he has given the lesson (i. 6) that
true godliness must have its root in patience. It is a
perfect trust, which rests securely on the Father's love,
and willingly waits His time. The hearts of the faithful
ones must have found solace in the thought which he
here joins to his former teaching. The trials they
endure are grievous, but "The Lord knows" is an
unfailing support. The floods of ungodliness make
His servants many a time afraid; but when they feel
that there, as amid the raging ocean, the Lord ruleth,
they are not overwhelmed. They are protected by
Omnipotence; and the tiny grains of sand, which check
the fierce tide, are an emblem of how out of weakness
He can ordain strength. Hence there comes a knowledge
to the struggling saint which makes him full of
courage, whatever trials threaten. The world has its
wrathful Nebuchadnezzars, whose threats at times are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
as a fiery furnace; but he is proof against them all
who can say and feel, "The Lord knows." I am not
careful nor disturbed; my God, in whom I trust, is
able to deliver me, and He will deliver me. The Lord
knoweth the way of the godly, and His knowledge
means safety and eternal deliverance.</p>

<p><em>And to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the
day of judgement.</em> The unrighteous&mdash;yes, over them
too God keeps ward. They cannot hide themselves
from Him, and through their conscience He makes
life a continuous chastisement. They may seem to
men to walk on heedlessly, but they have hidden
tortures of which their fellows can take no count.
Even the offender against human laws, who dreads
that his sin will be found out, carries in his bosom a
constant scourge. Fear hath torment (&#954;&#8057;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;),
and this it is of which the Apostle speaks. And if the
dread of man's judgement can work terror, how much
sorer must their alarm be who have the fiery indignation
of the wrath of God in their thoughts and stinging
their soul. Such men are kept all their life long under
punishment. Yet in this constant anguish we trace
God's mercy: He sends it that men may turn in time.
His blows on the sinful heart are meant to be remedial;
and those who disregard His chastisements to the last
will go away, self-condemned, self-destroyed, despisers
of Divine love, to a doom prepared, not for them, but
for the devil and his angels.</p>

<h3>"<em>BY THEIR FRUITS YE SHALL KNOW THEM</em>"</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement,
and despise dominion. Daring, self-willed, they tremble not to rail
at dignities: whereas angels, though greater in might and power,
bring not a railing judgement against them before the Lord. But
these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken
and destroyed, railing in matters whereof they are ignorant, shall in
their destroying surely be destroyed, suffering wrong as the hire of
wrong-doing; <em>men</em> that count it pleasure to revel in the daytime,
spots and blemishes, revelling in their lovefeasts while they feast
with you; having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from
sin; enticing unsteadfast souls; having a heart exercised in covetousness;
children of cursing; forsaking the right way, they went astray
having followed the way of Balaam the <em>son</em> of Beor, who loved the
hire of wrong-doing; but he was rebuked for his own transgression:
a dumb ass spake with man's voice and stayed the madness of the
prophet."&mdash;2 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> ii. 10-16.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Apostle now pictures in the darkest colours
the evil-doing and evil character of those who are
bringing into the Churches their "sects of perdition,"
those wolves in sheep's clothing who are mixing themselves,
and are likely to make havoc, among the flock
of Christ. He hopes that thus the brethren, being
forewarned, will also be forearmed. And not only does
he describe these bold offenders: he also reiterates in
many forms the certainty of their evil fate. They aim
at destroying others, and shall themselves meet destruction;
their wrong-doing shall bring a recompense in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
kind upon their own heads. They are a curse among
the people, but the curse will also fall on themselves;
they are agents of ruin, and shall perish in the overthrow
which they are devising.</p>

<p><em>But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
defilement, and despise dominion.</em> These chiefly&mdash;that is,
above other sinners&mdash;does God keep under punishment.
It cannot be otherwise, for on them His chastisements
have little effect. They have entered on a road from
which return is rare, neither do they take hold on the
paths of life; their whole bent is for that which
defileth, not only defiling them, but spreading defilement
on every side. They are renegades, too, from the
service of Christ; and having cast off their allegiance
to Him, they make their lust their law. The verse
describes the same character in two aspects: those
who walk after the flesh follow no prompting but
appetite, have no lord but self.</p>

<p><em>Daring, self-willed, they tremble not to rail at dignities.</em>
The Apostle passes on to describe another and more
terrible manifestation of the lawlessness of these false
teachers. They have so sunk themselves in the grossness
of material self-indulgence that they revile and
set at nought the spiritual world and the powers that
exist therein. In the term "dignities" the Apostle's
thoughts are of the angels, against whom these sinners
scruple not to utter their blasphemies. The good
angels, the messengers from heaven to earth, the
ministering spirits sent forth to minister to those who
shall be heirs of salvation, they are bold to deny;
while concerning the evil angels, to whose temptations
they have surrendered themselves, they scoff, representing
their lives as free and self-chosen, and at their
own disposal. The two terms "daring," "self-willed,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
seem to point respectively to these two forms of
blasphemy. They tremble not, they dare to deny the
existence of the good, and they shrink not to mock at
the influence of the powers of evil. Thus in mind and
thought they are as debased as in their bodies, and by
their lessons they corrupt as much as by their acts.</p>

<p><em>Whereas angels, though greater in might and power,
bring not a railing judgement against them before the
Lord.</em> The explanation of this passage is not without
difficulty, because of the indefiniteness of the words
"against them." To whom is reference here made?
It can hardly be questioned that by &#948;&#8057;&#958;&#945;&#953;, "dignities,"
literally "glories," in the previous verse the Apostle
meant angels, the dignities of the spirit-world, in
contradistinction to &#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#962;, "dominion," in which he
before referred to those earthly authorities whom these
false teachers set at nought. The verbs used in the
two clauses support this view. The dominion they
venture to despise, at the dignities they rail, whereas
they ought to be afraid of them. Now even to the
fallen angels there attaches a dignity by reason of their
first estate. In the New Testament the chief of them
is called by Christ Himself the "prince of this world"
(John xiv. 30), and by St. Paul "the prince of the
power of the air" (Eph. ii. 2); and he has a sovereignty
over those who shared his rebellion and his fall.
Having described the railing of the false teachers in
the previous verse as directed alike against the evil
angels and the good, it seems preferable here to take
"against them" as applying to the evil angels. Even
against them, though they must be conscious of their
sin and rebellion against God, the good angels, who
still abide in the presence of the Lord, bring no railing
judgement, utter no reproach or upbraiding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>There may have been in St. Peter's thought that
solemn scene depicted in Zech. iii., where, in the
presence of the angel of the Lord, that highest angel
who is Jehovah's special representative, Joshua the
high-priest appears, and at his right hand Satan standing
to be his adversary, and to charge him, and the
nation through him, with their remissness in the work
of the restoration of God's temple. There the angel
of the Lord, full of mercy, as Satan was full of hate,
checked the adversary's accusation, saying, "The Lord
rebuke thee, Satan." The same application of the
words "against them" is suggested by the apocryphal
illustration in St. Jude (ver. 9), where in the contention
about the body of Moses no greater rebuke is administered
to the devil by the archangel Michael.</p>

<p>This exposition does not remove all difficulty. For
as the angels in the verse appear to be spoken of
as superior in might and power to these corrupt
teachers, it seems natural at first sight to refer to
them the indefinite expression, and to explain that the
angels, though they be so exalted, bring no railing
judgement before God against these teachers and their
evil doings. But from what Scripture tells us of the
angels, it is not easy to understand how or why they
should bring such a judgement. Nowhere is such
an office assigned to, or exercised by, these spiritual
beings, nor are we anywhere told that the observance
of the deeds of the wicked is in their province. They
rejoice over one sinner that repenteth; they stand in
God's presence as the representatives of spotless innocence;
they are sent forth by God as His messengers
of judgement and of love; but we never find them as
accusers of the wicked. That office Satan has taken
for his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>But the words which the Apostle uses seem hardly
to make it necessary that the comparison should be
between angels and these teachers of destruction. In
the passage of Zechariah which we judge to have
been in St. Peter's mind when he wrote, the angel
is that mightiest spirit among the angelic host who
is identified in the language of the prophet with
Jehovah Himself; and the angel in St. Jude's illustration
is the archangel Michael. Conceiving that by
"angels" St. Peter intends these chief members of the
celestial powers, the sentence may be taken to mean
that the most glorious beings among the angelic throng,
those who are greater in might and power than the
"dignities" of whom he has spoken, bring no railing
judgement even against the fallen angels, whereas these
men presume to blaspheme beings of an order far
above themselves. Such a conception of subordination
in the spirit-world as is here suggested is not foreign
to New Testament thought. St. Paul speaks of the
angels in heaven as representing "principality, power,
might, and dominion" (Eph. i. 21); and in the same
Epistle the evil angels are mentioned in like terms:
"the principalities, the powers, the world-rulers of this
darkness" (vi. 12). Similar language is found also
in Col. i. 16. Taking this view of St. Peter's meaning,
the daring and presumption of these false teachers
are set in a stronger contrast. Whereas the highest
angels, those who stand first among the heavenly host
and dwell in the immediate presence of the Lord, though
they might accuse Satan and his angels of rebellion, yet
refrain; these bold transgressors among the race of men
cast forth their blasphemy against the whole spiritual
world.</p>

<p><em>But these, as creatures without reason, born mere</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
<em>animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters
whereof they are ignorant, shall in their destroying surely
be destroyed.</em> The glory of man in creation is his reason.
It is bestowed that he may freely, and not by constraint,
consent unto the will of God, and also may by
it discipline the body and hinder it from becoming his
master. For the soul tabernacling in the flesh there
is ever this peril, and by it these false teachers in the
Asian Churches had been ensnared. Thus they were
degraded, and were frustrating the end for which the
light of reason was given. They were become like the
horse and mule, which have no understanding. When
the serpent tempted Eve, he set before her his own
elevation through the fruit which to her was forbidden.</p>

<p class="center">
"I of brute human, ye of human gods,"<br />
</p>

<p>was his tempting speech. These men had given
themselves up for a less noble bribe. The bait of
sensual indulgence was offered, and their acceptance of
it had brought them down to the level of creatures
without reason. Their conduct and their lessons
merited such a comparison, and showed how their
nobler part had been warped by excess. To blaspheme
against the powers of the spirit-world is conduct
which can only be paralleled by that of the senseless
animals, which, with utter ignorance of consequences,
will rush upon objects whose strength they know not,
and perish in their blind onslaught. But the beasts
were born to be taken and destroyed; no higher fate
was in their power. Men were meant for a nobler
end, and it is only when the rein is given to appetite
that they become from human brutish in their knowledge,
more brutish than to know. Thus in their
ignorance they rail at all loftier thought, and of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
railing make a show of knowledge. Here they are
more noxious than the unreasoning brutes. Their
blinding lessons gain a hearing; and those who listen
are drawn on by the same lust, and willingly follow
after ignorance. But the work of all carries condemnation
with it. Man, whose gaze was meant ever to be
upward, is bowed down to earth like the beasts of the
field, which are meant only for capture and destruction.
On such perversion God will surely visit. They shall
reap the fruit of their bold self-will, and in the time of
their visitation they shall perish.</p>

<p><em>Suffering wrong as the hire of wrong-doing.</em> The
Authorised Version translates a somewhat different
text (&#954;&#959;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#8059;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;), "and shall receive the reward of
wrong-doing." This is the easier sentence, and connects
itself well with what precedes; but it has not the
strongest support. By the text which the Revised
Version has adopted (&#7936;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8059;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;) the Apostle does
not mean that these sinners meet a punishment which
they have not deserved, and in that sense suffer wrong;
but that they are themselves brought under the
penalties of the wrong into which they are leading
others. As the Psalmist says, their wickedness comes
down on their own pate, and in the net which they
hid privily is their own foot taken. They differ from
Balaam, whose example St. Peter is soon about to
instance. These men secure the reward they seek,
larger resources to squander on their lust; yet this,
their success, as they would call it, proves their overthrow.</p>

<p><em>Men that count it pleasure to revel in the daytime.</em>
They that are drunken are drunken in the night, and
the same holds ordinarily of other excesses. They
come not to the light because their deeds are evil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
But these men have cast aside all such timorousness.
They find a zest in outrage and in going beyond
others, so as to add the daytime to the night for their
indulgences. The sense of "luxury that lasts but for
a day," that is ephemeral, and perishes in the using,
is hardly to be extracted from the Greek; but with
St. James (v. 5) in mind, where the verb is connected
with the noun of this verse, "Ye have lived delicately
on the earth and taken your pleasure," it may perhaps
be allowable, as some have done, to interpret &#7952;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8051;&#961;&#945;
as signifying "the time of this present life." The men
live as though life were bestowed for no other object
than their revelry.</p>

<p><em>Spots and blemishes.</em> St. Peter must have had in his
thought the epithets which he applied to Christ: "a
lamb without blemish and without spot" (1 Peter i. 9).
Utterly alien to the spirit and life of Jesus is these
men's wantonness. They belong rather to him who
is described as a roaring lion, walking about to find
whom he may devour.</p>

<p><em>Revelling in their lovefeasts while they feast with you.</em>
Here also the Revised Version accepts a text different
from that rendered by the Authorised, which for the
first clause has "sporting themselves with their own
deceivings" (&#7936;&#960;&#8049;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#962;). This refers to "the feigned
words" with which they have been pictured as making
a gain of the unstable souls whom they lead astray.
They find a sport in their delusion, a pleasure, which
is devilish, in the evil they are working. The other
reading, &#7936;&#947;&#8049;&#960;&#945;&#953;&#962;, which is also found in Jude 12, refers
to those gatherings of the faithful in the earliest period
of the Church's history where the brethren by partaking
in common of a simple meal gave a symbol of
Christian equality and love. It may be that this in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
its origin was the assembling of the congregation for
"the breaking of bread," but we soon find the social
meal had become a distinct observance. And we know
from St. Paul's letter to the Church of Corinth that
disorder was introduced into these meetings, and that
luxury and disparity ofttimes took the place of simplicity
and equality. "In your eating," says the Apostle,
"each one taketh before other his own supper, and one
is hungry, and another is drunken.... When ye come
together tarry one for another" (1 Cor. xi. 21). In
these Asian congregations the evil had gone to a greater
length. Instead of a sober assembly, where friendly
converse might form a fitting accompaniment to the
more solemn breaking of bread in remembrance of
their Lord, these lovefeasts were converted into a revel
by the luxurious additions which the false teachers
took care to have supplied. The Apostle calls them
<em>their</em> lovefeasts, because it was from their conduct that
the gathering took its character. The members of the
Church were indeed invited, but these men made themselves
leaders of the meal, and turned what was meant
to be a simple repast into a scene of riot and indulgence.
But such excess only opens the floodgates
for more.</p>

<p><em>Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease
from sin.</em> These preachers of freedom from the
restraints of the Law must make their evil liberty
known, and so they shamelessly parade it even in
the meetings of the brethren. They cast about them
their licentious glances, and their lustful gaze is unchecked.
Nay, they have so given it rein that now
it is beyond their control. Their eyes <em>cannot</em> cease
from sin. The original speaks of "eyes full of an
adulteress." By this unusual expression the Apostle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
seems to point to the danger that such conduct would
meet with a response, that the sisters in the Church
would be beguiled and led to join hands with these
teachers of licence. With this we may compare the
language addressed to the Church of Thyatira concerning
"the woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a
prophetess, and teacheth and seduceth My servants
to commit fornication" (Rev. ii. 20).</p>

<p><em>Enticing unstedfast souls; having a heart exercised in
covetousness; children of cursing.</em> A very pestilence
must such men have been to the Churches. For there
are always many to be found who are not established
in the truth, though it be present with them, men
whom the bait of a promised freedom, with its assumption
of superiority, will always catch. There is in it
a witchery worse even than that which, in another
direction, had once before led the Galatians astray.
Satan himself offers the temptation, and finds allies
within men's hearts to help his cause. It is only by
those stedfast in the faith that he can be withstood
(1 Peter v. 9). They look beyond to-day, and to a
brighter, purer joy than any which he can offer. So
they are safe. But, alas! in the Churches such men
are often but the remnant, and the trade of the beguiler
makes its gain in every age. And it was for material
gain these men were laying themselves out; and, that
they might be perfect in their craft, they had put
themselves, as it were, to school, gone through a
training. As was said of Israel in old time (Jer.
xxii. 17), their eyes and their heart are but for their
covetousness, greed of defilement, and greed of gain.
Children of cursing are they in a double sense: they
are a curse to those whom they lead astray; and in
spite of the popularity which for a time they will seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
to enjoy, there is no blessing upon them. Their doom
is foretold from of old. The lamp of God's prophecy
makes it clear that such men are the children of Cain.</p>

<p><em>Forsaking the right way, they went astray, having
followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved
the hire of wrong-doing.</em> It is an aggravation of wrong-doing
when those who know the good willingly choose
the evil. Of such men there is little hope. To wander
is their choice; and as wrong paths are many, and the
right but one, they become wanderers to the end.
That the closing of their eyes was in these teachers
a self-chosen course we see from the example which
St. Peter has chosen to illustrate their character.
Balaam, however he gained his knowledge and however
unworthy he was to possess it, certainly knew
much of Jehovah, and had been used to keep alive the
knowledge of God among the heathen round about
him; but his heart was not whole with God. To be
known as the prophet of the Lord was a reputation
which he prized, but mainly, as it seems, for the
credit it gave him among his fellows. When the
chance came, he would fain endeavour to serve two
masters. It has been for ever true, "Ye cannot serve
God and mammon"; but Balaam resolved to try. He
thought by importunity to prevail with God for so much
liberty of speech as would gain Balak's silver and gold.
When his intention was thwarted, and his mouth was
filled with blessings instead of curses, he still hankered
after Balak's honours and money, and wrought for
Israel by his counsel the curse which his lips were
hindered from uttering.</p>

<p>And these teachers of licence in the name of freedom
moved among the Christian Churches as though they
were true brethren. They used Christian phrases in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
their "feigned words," yet were ready to lead their
followers in a way as dissolute as that which the son
of Beor suggested to the Midianites (Num. xxxi. 16)
that the children of Israel might trespass against the
Lord. For these men's hearts were set on the hire
of wrong-doing. Yet their offence was even fouler
than Balaam's, for to their lust and covetousness they
added hypocrisy.</p>

<p><em>But he was rebuked for his own transgression: a
dumb ass spake with man's voice and stayed the madness
of the prophet.</em> The word which St. Peter here uses
for "rebuke", and which is found nowhere else in the
New Testament, implies a rebuke administered by
argument, a refutation such as reasonable persons will
yield to. The dumb ass (St. Peter's word is literally
<em>beast of burden</em>) appealed to her conduct all her life
through. Was I ever wont to do this unto thee?
Should I do so now without good reason? The reason
was made plain at the sight of the angel. That
presence made the rider bow his head and fall on his
face. But what excuse was there for his lawlessness?
For that is the sense which the Apostle puts on
Balaam's transgression. And the word which he adds
makes the rebuke more strong. It was <em>his own</em> transgression.
The swerving of the dumb beast was not
of herself. She would have held to the right way had
it been possible, but her master's lawlessness was
very madness; and he was the prophet, she the
speechless brute. It has been said, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quem Deus vult
perdere prius dementat</i>. But the proverb is not true.
The destruction is not of God's will; the madness
comes of a self-chosen course of rebellion. Ever God's
voice is, as it was of old, "It is thy destruction, O
Israel, that thou art against Me, against thy help"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
(Hos. xiii. 9). The ruin is self-destruction, an
infatuation which will accept no remonstrance, brook
no check. For the warning voice of the dumb beast
only hindered Balaam's evil project for a brief moment;
and though the Divine power which loosed the tongue
of the ass kept her master's in check, the maddening
greed for Balak's gold was in his heart, and at all costs
would be satisfied, and led him to destruction. Such
is the penalty of those who willingly desert the right
way through love of the hire of wrong-doing. In
forsaking God, they forsake the fountain of wisdom.
Then their lawlessness degrades their human endowments
to the level of the brutish, and the obedient
drudging of the dumb beasts of burden speaks loud&mdash;for
God gives it a tongue&mdash;against the mad errors of
rebellious men.</p>

<h3><em>ALTOGETHER BECOME ABOMINABLE</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm;
for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved. For, uttering
great swelling <em>words</em> of vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by
lasciviousness, those who are just escaping from them that live in
error; promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants
of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same
is he also brought into bondage. For if, after they have escaped the
defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome,
the last state is become worse with them than the first. For it were
better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than,
after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered
unto them. It has happened unto them according to the true proverb,
The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had
washed to wallowing in the mire."&mdash;2 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> ii. 17-22.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Apostle now describes these traitors to the
cause of Christ under another aspect. They
proffer themselves as guides and teachers. As such
they should be sources of refreshment and help. But
in every respect they belie the character which they
have assumed. <em>These are springs without water.</em> The
blessing of a spring is only known to the full in
Eastern lands. Hence it is that in Bible language
wells and fountains are constantly used as emblematic
of happiness. When Israel is brought out of Egypt,
their destination is described as "a land of fountains."
Mental and spiritual blessings are pictured by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
figure: "The mouth of a righteous man is a well of
life" (Prov. x. 11); "The wellspring of wisdom is a
flowing brook" (Prov. xviii. 4). The invitation which
the prophet publishes in God's name runs, "Ho, every
one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters" (Isa. lv. 1);
and the gracious promise is, "With joy shall ye draw
water out of the wells of salvation" (Isa. xii. 3). To
those who had been accustomed to language of this
sort St. Peter's words convey a picture of utter disappointment.
Where men had a right to expect that
they would find brightness and refreshment, where
they were promised an oasis in the world's desert, there
proved to be only a delusive mirage; and for this the
brethren were beguiled to forsake the living waters
which Christ has promised to His faithful ones. <em>And
mists driven by a storm.</em> Here the same thought is put
into another shape. Mists, resting above the ground,
play a part like that of the watersprings beneath. They
protect from scorching heat, and drop down blessing on
the thirsty land. But when they are chased away by
the whirlwind, they can furnish neither protection nor
nourishment. And so helpless for those who followed
them were these apostles of licence. Like mists they
were, it is true, but only in their blinding influence.
They brought with them blasts of vain doctrine, in their
craftiness, after the wiles of error, and so created a
desolation for those who sought unto them. We cannot
help comparing this description with the ever-increasing
illumination that flows from the lamp of prophecy,
making the world's dark places light.</p>

<p><em>For whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved.</em>
Yes, for these also God has a destiny in store. It is
reserved, as is the incorruptible inheritance (1 Peter i. 4)
which awaits His faithful ones. But it is in those pits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
of darkness to which the rebellious angels were committed.
Yet even in the Apostle's language there shines
out somewhat of God's mercy. The sinner's doom is
certain, but the blow has not yet fallen; the blackness
of darkness is prepared, but was not prepared for men.
Only those fall into it who persist in their rebellion.
For them, in the words of Christ, it will be the outer
darkness, where is the weeping and the gnashing of
teeth.</p>

<p><em>For, uttering great swelling words of vanity, they entice
in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who are
just escaping from them that live in error.</em> St. Peter's
words are here very aptly chosen to contrast the boastful
pretensions of these corrupters with the hollowness
and delusion of all they promise. St. Jude (16) tells
of the great swelling words, but does not add that
further touch which proclaims their emptiness; St. Paul
(1 Tim. i. 6) says that such men fall to their vain and
boastful talking because they have swerved from purity
of heart, from a good conscience, and from faith unfeigned.
From such there is nothing to be expected
but falseness and unreality; they arrogate to themselves
a penetration which others have not. Theirs it is
to have found a deeper meaning in revelation, to have
worked their way to a freedom beyond the rest, a
freedom in the midst of sin, which imparts to those who
attain to it a freedom to sin with impunity. Thus do
they entice in the lusts of the flesh by lasciviousness.
Such a liberty suits the natural man; such guides find
many to follow them.</p>

<p>True Christian freedom, the freedom of St. Paul, calls
for constant watchfulness, earnest anxiety at every step,
for life is full of treacherous roads. But forethought
and carefulness are lacking for the most part in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
who have just escaped from the entanglements of error.
"I buffet my body," was the Apostle's rule, "and bring
it into bondage" (1 Cor. ix. 27). This was the discipline
to free the soul. And to others he preaches in
his letter to Timothy that "the grace of God hath appeared,
bringing salvation to all men" (2 Tim. ii. 11).
But mark the pathway which leads to this life: "Instructing
us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and
worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
godly in this present world." Such precepts these men
mocked at. There was a nobler knowledge, they said,
a higher initiation. To this they had attained; to this
they beguiled their followers.</p>

<p>Such men are unspeakably dangerous to those who
have made but little progress in spiritual life. It is only
those who, like Nehemiah of old, have become firm of
purpose through prayer to the God of heaven, and know
the dangers that everywhere beset them, that can withstand
such temptation. As he laboured amid the ruins
of Jerusalem, which he was so zealous to restore, there
came to him the invitation of the Samaritans, "Come,
let us meet together; ... let us take counsel together"
(Neh. vi.). No doubt the village in the plain of Ono, to
which they asked him to come, was a pleasanter place
just then than the bare hill-top of Zion, with its desolation
and ruins. But his heart misgave him at the words
of such counsellors. "They thought to do me mischief."
And his sturdy answer to the tempters is a pattern and
a lesson for all time: "I am doing a great work, so
that I cannot come down." For it is always to come
<em>down</em> that such counsellors invite us, not to be afraid of
putting ourselves on their level. They may cloke it
under the name of elevation, as these Asian tempters
did. They talk of this as liberty and power, just as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
archfiend himself spake to the Saviour, tempting Him
to a boastful display of His trust in His Father: "Cast
Thyself down." Those who fall fall in this way, by a too
ready yielding to some acceptable bait; and then they
find themselves, not free, but prisoners. And the weak
in the faith, those who are only just escaped from error,
are those from among whom the deluders seek and find
their victims.</p>

<p><em>Promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants
of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome,
of the same is he also brought into bondage.</em> Here we
have two views of the same persons. First their own
picture. They proclaim their superiority in lofty terms.
Satan and his servants have always been liberal with
promises. "Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and
evil," "All these things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall
down and worship me," are sample speeches of the arch-tempter.
And these men follow their master; but,
says the Apostle, they are themselves in the grossest
slavery. He personifies Destruction as a power who
holds them in her chains. And the idea sets sin before
us in a terrible light. It begins in the single act, over
which men fancy they have entire control; but the
acts become a habit, and this, like a mighty, living power
within men, but beyond their sway, overmasters their
whole being, and drives them at its will. In the case of
these men, no faculty was free; their very eyes could
not cease from sin.</p>

<p><em>For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the
world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome,
the last state is become worse with them than the
first.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corruptio optimi pessima</i> is a well-known and
very true dictum, and the Apostle sets these false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
teachers before us as a notable illustration of it. The
backsliders, the renegades who desert a good cause, are
sure to exhibit intense hostility to the position from
which they have fallen away. They are constrained to
do so that men may think they have a warrant for
their conduct; and often they have an uneasy conscience,
which they must try to silence by large assertion of the
rectitude and wisdom of what they do. Satan himself
is the great instance. The state from which by rebellion
he fell was unspeakably glorious, a life in the
presence of perfect holiness. Now he takes his pleasure
in marring everything that is holy, in defiling God's
world and filling it with pollution through the sin which
he has introduced.</p>

<p>These Asian backsliders had tasted the good grace of
God. The Apostle speaks of their knowledge of Christ
as that true comprehension of His love and mercy
which draws men away from the world and its allurements.
They had escaped and found a camp of refuge.
But to take service under Christ means to bear the
cross, and to bear it patiently. Jesus puts His servants
to the proof, and not all who have set their hands
to the plough continue stedfast in their work till the
harvest comes. They halt in the process of that growth
of grace which St. Peter describes in the first chapter of
this letter. In their temperance they should provide
patience, endurance in well-doing. Many, however, persevere
but for a little time; and the world seizes the
opportunity of their doubt and hesitation, comes forward
with its allurements, and captures the weak in faith.
And such were these men, and their capture was fatal.
They were now in the toils of a net from which there
was little chance of escape; they were overcome and
made very slaves. In their first efforts to walk with Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
they had been enabled to wrest themselves away from
their evil life; but now they were sunk down, overpowered,
and blind, with a blindness the more terrible
because they had known what it was to have sight.
Their last state was unspeakably worse than the first.</p>

<p>St. Peter has in mind the parable of his Master
(Matt. xii.; Luke xi.) which was spoken prophetically of
the Jewish people. There Christ tells of the evil spirit
which has been cast out, but no attempt made to fill his
place with a better tenant. Soon finding no rest, he returns,
and beholds his former home swept, and garnished,
and unoccupied. Then he goes and takes seven other
spirits more wicked than himself, who enter with him
and dwell there. With what solemn meaning come
those words which follow the parable, "Blessed are
they that hear the word of God and <em>keep</em> it!" (Luke xi.
28). To have heard, and not to have kept, indeed makes
the last state worse than the first.</p>

<p><em>For it were better for them not to have known the way of
righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from
the holy commandment delivered unto them.</em> These
words of the Apostle point out the fear and care which
should possess the hearts of those whom God blesses
with large opportunities: fear lest they receive them
amiss and fail to value them; care lest they pervert
them to a wrong use. Our Lord's own words form the
mightiest homily thereon when He spake to those cities
of Galilee upon whom a great light was shining as He
dwelt in their midst, but He could not do His mighty
works there because of their unbelief. "He came unto
His own, and His own received Him not." Hence the
solemn denunciations of woe upon them: "It shall be
more tolerable in the judgement for Tyre and Sidon, for
Sodom and Gomorrah, than for them"; "The queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
of the south shall rise up in the judgement against
them and condemn." And more sorrowfully still He
speaks to Jerusalem: "If thou hadst known in this
thy day the things that belong unto thy peace, but now
they are hid from thine eyes."</p>

<p>Christ went away unto the Father, but He left the
Apostles their commission to teach the way of righteousness
as He had taught it. "Teach them," He says, "to
observe all things whatsoever I have told you; and lo,
I am with you always." By the ministrations of St. Paul
and his fellow-labourers the feet of these Asian converts
had been set in the right way. They had made a
profession of faith in Christ's sacrifice, and thus had
been reckoned among the righteous, among those called
to be saints. But the journey unto righteousness is
made by daily steps in keeping God's law; and if these
be not taken, the road may lie open, the traveller may
see it, but he comes no nearer to the goal. Nay, in this
road there is no standing still. They who fail to press
forward inevitably slide back. It was here that these
false teachers had failed. The command of God checked
their evil appetites and greed; and so they set it at
defiance and turned aside, and taught their deluded
followers that God's freedom in its highest sense meant
a licence to sin.</p>

<p>Here one of the Apostle's words is very significant.
He says, not holy commandments, but holy commandment,
telling us thus that the Divine law is all comprehended
in the right ordering of the heart. In
principle all God's laws are one. If that inward source
of all our right and wrong be kept pure, from it are
the issues of life; and every action flowing from it will
then have a righteous aim. Thus men lead holy lives;
thus they keep God's commandments in every relation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
They do not in this life become free from offence;
they stumble, because they are compassed by infirmity.
But they act from a right motive; and this, and not the
sum-total of results, is what the loving Father of men
regards. Thus the Divine law is the law of true
freedom, supplying a principle, but leaving the particular
actions to develop according to the circumstances of
each man's life. This is the freedom of which the
Psalmist sings: "I will walk at liberty, for I seek Thy
precepts" (Psalm cxix. 45); and one of our own poets
extols a life so ordered by Divine law as the truest,
grandest freedom:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Obedience is greater than freedom. What's free?</div>
<div class="line">The vexed straw on the wind, the tossed foam on the sea;</div>
<div class="line">The great ocean itself, as it rolls and it swells,</div>
<div class="line">In the bonds of a boundless obedience dwells."</div>
</div></div>

<p><em>It has happened unto them according to the true proverb,
The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that
had washed to wallowing in the mire.</em> To describe in
all its horror the abysmal depth to which these false
teachers have sunk, the Apostle makes use of two
proverbs, one of which he adapts from the Old Testament
(Prov. xxvi. 11), while the other is one which
would impress the Jewish mind with a feeling of
utter abomination. The dogs of the East are the
pariahs of the animal world, while everything pertaining
to swine was detestable in the eyes of the Israelite.
But all the loathing which attached to these outcasts
of the brute creation did not suffice to portray the
defilement of these teachers of lies and their apostate
lives. It needed those other grosser features&mdash;the
return to the disgorged meal; the greed for filth, where
a temporary cleansing serves, as it were, to give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
relish for fresh wallowing&mdash;these traits were needed
ere the full vileness of those sinners could be expressed.</p>

<p>Solomon spake his proverb of the fool who goes
back to his folly; but of how much grosser lapse is he
guilty who, having known the mercy of Christ, having
tasted the Father's grace, having been illumined by the
Holy Spirit, turns again to the world and its pollutions,
goes back into the far country, far away from God,
and chooses again for his food the husks that the
swine did eat!</p>

<h3><em>AS WERE THE DAYS OF NOAH</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"This is now, beloved, the second epistle that I write unto you;
and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by putting you in
remembrance; that ye should remember the words which were
spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandment of the
Lord and Saviour through your apostles; knowing this first, that in
the last days mockers shall come with mockery, walking after their
own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of His coming? for,
from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they
were from the beginning of the creation."&mdash;<span class="smcap">2 Peter</span> iii. 1-4.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the previous chapter the Apostle showed how
the renegade false teachers had published among
the brethren their seductive doctrine, declaring that
God's fatherly discipline was something which they
need not undergo, that the trials which He sent them
might be escaped, and the natural bent of man's heart
indulged as fully as they pleased. The foul results
of such lessons both to the flock and to the teachers
he also depicted in such wise as to render them
abhorrent. Now he tells of a further lesson which
these guides on the downward road added to the
former. Those who do not accept God's judgements
here soon go on to deny the coming of judgement
hereafter. It could hardly be otherwise. The wish
is father to the thought as truly in matters of faith as
of practice. Men whose lives are all centred on this
world must try and convince themselves, if possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
that the day of the Lord, of which God's word speaks
so often, is a delusion, and may be cast out of their
thoughts. This these men did, and it is against this
scoffing of theirs that St. Peter directs his exhortation
in this chapter.</p>

<p><em>This is now, beloved, the second epistle that I write unto
you.</em> Judging from the adverb which he uses (&#7972;&#948;&#951;,
now, already), we should conclude that no long time had
elapsed between the Apostle's first letter and the second.
And by calling this the second, he shows that it is
intended for the same congregations as the former,
though he has not named them in the salutation with
which the letter opens. Aforetime they had been tried
by inward questionings, and he sent them his exhortation
and testimony that, spite of all their trials, this
was the true grace of God which they had received,
and therein they should stand fast (1 Peter v. 12). Now
the danger is from without: false doctrine and evil
living as its consequence. So, though he may have
written but a little while ago, he will neither spare
himself, nor neglect them. For the danger is of the
utmost gravity. It threatens the overthrow of all true
Christian life.</p>

<p><em>And in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by
putting you in remembrance.</em> Mark how trustfully he
appeals to the sincerity of the minds of the brethren,
just as before (i. 12) he said they knew the things of
which he was putting them in remembrance, and were
established in the truth which they had received. And
what he means by the "mind" we may see from
1 Peter i. 13, where he uses the same word: "Gird
up the loins of your mind"&mdash;do not indulge vain, lax,
and speculative opinions, as though these would forward
you in your travel through the world&mdash;"be sober, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought
unto you." A mind so braced looks onward to the
revelation of Jesus Christ, looks for every token of
its drawing nigh. And because it is sincere, the man
dare look into its inmost recesses, and by self-examination
and discipline maintain its purity. He can think
soberly of the Lord's coming because he is preparing
for it. But he whose mind is dark, within whom the
light has been turned into darkness, dare not think on
these things, but with all his might endeavours to
forget, ignore, and deny them. All that St. Peter
thinks needful for these Asian brethren is that he
should remind them. He knows that men's minds are
prone to slumber, especially about the things unseen
as yet; and his aim is to rouse them to thorough
vigilance. But he has no new lesson to give them.</p>

<p><em>That ye should remember the words which were spoken
before by the holy prophets.</em> On few themes do the
prophets dwell more earnestly than on those visitations
of Jehovah which they publish as the coming of the
day of the Lord. With Joel (ii. 11, 32) it is to be a
time great and terrible, the prospect of which is to
move men to repentance, for whosoever shall call upon
the name of the Lord shall be delivered. And Israel
were taught in many ways that this great day was
constantly at hand. They were pointed to it by Isaiah
(xiii. 6) when the overthrow of Babylon was foretold.
For that nation the day of the Lord was coming as
destruction from the Almighty. Jeremiah (xlvi. 10)
and Ezekiel (xxx. 3) preach the same lesson, with the
ruin of Egypt for their text. It is a day of vengeance,
when the Lord God of hosts will avenge Him of His
adversaries, a day of clouds, in which a sword shall
come upon Egypt, and her foundations shall be broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
down. By what they beheld around them God's people
were to learn that a like day would come upon them
also, upon everything that was high and lifted up
against God; and for those who were unprepared
another prophet (Amos v. 18) declared that it would
be darkness, and not light. Before its coming, therefore,
they were urged (Zeph. ii. 3) to turn to the Lord, that
they might be hid in the day of His anger. For God
designed by it to make Himself King of all the earth
(Zech. xiv. 9), wherefore it would be great and terrible.
For though Elijah should first be sent (Mal. iv. 5) to
turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the
hearts of the children to their fathers, in its manifestation
that day should still be like a refiner's fire to purge
the evil from among the good.</p>

<p>Not without solemn purpose were all these words
written aforetime, and the Christian preachers who
felt that God was faithful were sure that such a day
would come upon all the earth. How it would be
manifested was for God, and not for them. Some of
those who lived when St. Peter wrote beheld part of
its accomplishment in the overthrow of the Holy City.
But they felt&mdash;and their lesson is one for all time&mdash;that
it is presumptuous in men to compute God's days, and
that it is rebellious blindness not to acknowledge the
coming of His day continually in the great crises of
history. How many a time since St. Peter spoke
has the Lord proclaimed by partial judgements the
certainty of that which shall come at the last. The
day of the Lord is attested when empires fall, when
hordes of barbarians break in upon the civilised world
that has grown careless of God, when convulsions
rage like those which preceded the Reformation and
which shook Europe at the French Revolution, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
may add to these the troubles which harass our own
land to-day. All these things preach the same doctrine;
all proclaim that verily there is a God that judgeth the
earth. Not yet is the voice of prophecy silent. Oh
that men would but remember how long and how
surely it has been speaking!</p>

<p><em>And the commandment of the Lord and Saviour
through your apostles.</em> In connexion with the subject
on which he is writing, the commandment of Jesus to
which St. Peter alludes can hardly be other than that
which occurs in the address of our Lord to His disciples
after His last visit to the Temple: "Watch therefore,
for ye know not on what day your Lord cometh; ...
therefore be ready, for in an hour that ye think not the
Son of man cometh" (Matt. xxiv. 42). And with the
last judgement in his thoughts, we cannot fail to be
struck with the frequency with which the Apostle in
this letter repeats as the title of Christ "the Lord and
Saviour" (i. 11; ii. 20; iii. 2, 18). This precise form
occurs in no other part of the New testament. And
it seems from the Apostle's use of it as though, while
speaking of the certainty of the coming of the day of
the Lord, he desired to give special prominence to
the thought that to such as were looking for Him
He would manifest Himself as the Saviour and
Redeemer.</p>

<p>The words "your apostles" also appear to be used
with design. They contain a direct acknowledgment
of the mission of St. Paul as an apostle. By him
more than by any other had these regions been
brought to the knowledge of Christ, and we may rest
confident that the gospel which he preached elsewhere
he preached to them also. The lesson of watchfulness
is oft repeated in his letters. To the Corinthians he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
writes, "Watch ye; stand fast in the faith; quit you like
men; be strong" (1 Cor. xvi. 13), while, in connexion
with this subject of the day of the Lord, his words to
the Thessalonians are, "Ye yourselves know perfectly
that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
night.... But ye are not in darkness, that that day
should overtake you as a thief. Let us watch and
be sober" (1 Thess. v. 2-6). St. Peter's letter was
to be read in those Galatian Churches whose members
in past days had doubted about the apostolate of St.
Paul. Its warnings would sink the deeper because
enforced by the authority of him who even in his
rebukes had spoken to them as his "little children"
(Gal. iv. 19).</p>

<p><em>Knowing this first, that in the last days mockers shall
come with mockery.</em> St. Peter says the mockers will
come; Polycarp<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> says in his day they had come.
He terms them the first-born of Satan, and tells how
they pervert the oracles of the Lord to their own
lusts and deny that there is either resurrection or
judgement. The signs of the times were not difficult
to read; and the Apostle would have the brethren
know what to look for, know in such wise that they
should not be shaken in mind by what they saw
or heard. For this the first need was Christian
sobriety. Thus settled, they could ponder on the
words of ancient prophecy and recall the lessons of
those who had spoken to them in the name of Christ;
and therewith their hearts might take comfort, and
their heads be lifted up with expectation, knowing the
last days were bringing their redemption nearer. The
mockery of the sinners would keep no bounds. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
he expresses by his emphatic words, just as largeness
of blessing is described: "In blessing I will bless thee."</p>

<p><em>Walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is
the promise of His coming?</em> They would be a law
unto themselves, and so they followed an evil law. As
sinners before them had said, "Our lips are our own"
(Psalm xii. 4), so these men by act and word alike proclaimed,
"Our lives are our own, to use as we please.
We have no account to give." Thus they made
themselves bondslaves to the lust of the flesh, the
lust of the eye, and the pride of life, and, with these
fetters heavy about them, boasted of their liberty.
They strengthened themselves in their evil way by
jeering at the thought of Christ's return to judgement.
"We have heard of the promise," they said, "but we see
no signs of its fulfilment. The angels, you say, spake
of His return when He was taken away from you.
Let Him make speed and hasten His coming, that we
may see it. You are for ever speaking of it as sure
and pointing us back to the ancient Scriptures, as
though they were a warrant for what you preach.
'Where is the word of the Lord? Let it come now'"
(Jer. xvii. 15).</p>

<p><em>For, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things
continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</em>
Here the mockers pass from the promise of Christ's
return, and fall back upon the more distant records as
supplying a stronger argument. "The fathers" of
whom they speak cannot be the Christian preachers.
Not many of them could as yet have fallen asleep in
death. But the ancient prophets of the Jewish Scriptures
had long ago passed away, and against them the
scorners direct their shafts. "Centuries ago," they urge,
"the prophetic record was closed; and its final utterance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
was of the day of the Lord, which has not yet come."
Their word, "fell asleep" may have also been used as
part of their mockery, classing the words of prophecy
among baseless dreams. It may be they intended
a special allusion to that one among the prophets who
dates the time of the Lord's coming. Daniel (xii. 12)
speaks of a waiting which shall last a thousand three
hundred and five-and-thirty days. But say these
scorners, "When his word was complete, he was bidden,
'Go thou thy way till the end be. For thou shalt rest,
and shalt stand in thy lot at the end of the days.' He
has fallen asleep, and the other fathers also. They all
are at rest, and the end of the days is no nearer. The
world stands fast, and will stand. It has seen no
change since it was brought into existence."</p>

<p>Those who in faith clung to Christ could not fail,
as they heard these scorners, to think of the Master's
question, "When the Son of man cometh, shall He
find faith in the earth?" (Luke xviii. 8), and of those
other words of His which told them that the last days
should be a parallel to the days of the Deluge: "As
were the days of Noah, so shall be the coming of the
Son of man. For as in those days which were before
the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and
giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered
into the ark, and they knew not until the flood came
and took them all away, so shall be the coming of the
Son of man" (Matt. xxiv. 37-39). The strong earth
was under the feet of those antediluvian mockers, the
firmament above their heads. So in ignorance they
jeered at what they would call the folly of Noah. But
the Flood came, and then they knew. Yet the last
days have seen, and will see, men as blind and as full
of satire and scoffing as they.</p>

<h3><em>JUDGEMENT TO COME</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"For this they wilfully forget, that there were heavens from of old,
and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the word
of God; by which means the world that then was, being overflowed
with water, perished: but the heavens that now are, and the earth,
by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against
the day of judgement and destruction of ungodly men."&mdash;<span class="smcap">2 Peter</span> iii.

<p>"The world lasts on" (&#948;&#953;&#945;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#949;&#953;) "through all times,"
say the scoffers, "just as it was at the Creation.
There has been no change; there will be none." But
out of their own mouth their folly is rebuked. How can
these men speak of a creation? If there is to be no
Judge, why believe that there has been a Creator?
That must be included in the general denial. <em>For this
they wilfully forget.</em> Yes, here is the reason of their
conduct, the root of all the evil. They forget because
they wish to forget; they speak of the fathers, but
of set purpose ignore the history of Noah; they are
casting God out of all their thoughts: and so even to
the things that are made, and by which He testifies to
all men alike His eternal power and Godhead, they
close their eyes, and refuse to read His wide-open
lesson-book. And still less do they regard all that His
written word records of the world's past history and
God's discipline for men therein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p><em>That there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted
out of water and amidst water, by the word of God.</em>
They close their ears as well as their eyes. "In the
beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
As the study of nature progresses men are learning
to comprehend more of the vastness of that phrase
"in the beginning," and in the light of science to read
a larger meaning into St. Peter's words, "There were
heavens from of old." But even in that generation
to which the Apostle soon alludes the unchanging
character of the skies spake of duration and permanence.
The antediluvian world had run a long
course; from Adam to Noah men had beheld the sun
rise and set daily in the skies, just as it rose on the
morning of the Deluge. And the mockers then living
could say, and doubtless did say, to the preacher in
their midst, "These things have always been as they
are, and will be so for evermore." The later scorners
had their prototypes of old, who pointed to the
existence of an eternal law, and wilfully forgot that
law implies a lawgiver, and that He who made must
have the power to unmake.</p>

<p>St. Peter takes their text, but reads from it a very
different lesson. There were heavens from of old, yea,
long before there was an earth fit for man to dwell in.
This world in that old time was formless and void, and
the waters covered its face like a garment. The word
of the Lord went forth, and the waters were gathered
together as a heap, and the depth was laid up in God's
storehouses. Then the dry land appeared; then there
was an earth. The streams took their appointed place
down the mountain-sides and in the valleys, and rivers
began to roll onward to the sea; the waters of ocean
learnt their bounds, neither turned again to cover the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
earth. The Divine word clothed in all the glory of
vegetation the hitherto barren land, making it a fit
home for man, who was not yet; and the water
ministered sustenance to everything that grew out of
the ground. Birds, beasts, and fishes were made, and
the waters were the birthplace of most of these. For
God said, "Let the water bring forth abundantly the
moving creature that hath life," not its own tenants
only, but fowl that may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven. So there was an earth,
not the bare ground only, but the whole wealth of
vegetable and animal life; and this was all existent,
compacted, supported out of water and by means of
water (&#948;&#953;' &#8021;&#948;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;). For without it nothing could have
flourished. God had laid up water above the firmament
and water below the earth, and by means of
watery vapour refreshed and blessed everything that
grew. This was the reign of God's law, and ere the
Flood came men could point to it and say, "What mean
you to talk of a deluge? The sand is made the
bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot
pass it; the earth is set high above the waters, and
has been so from old time." But that long duration
did not hinder the same productive, nurturing water
being turned, by the word of the Lord, into an agency
of destruction.</p>

<p><em>By which means the world that then was, being overflowed
with water, perished.</em> Every word in the Apostle's
sentence is meant to tell. God employed as means of
overthrow the very powers which at first He ordained
for blessing. His word makes things what they are.
The reign of law endures until He, who is before all
law and the source of all law, gives another direction
to those forces which His law has always been controlling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
In this way the world that then was, the
world which had endured and been stedfast from the
Creation to the Flood, perished. The world was full of
order, full of glory. The name (&#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;) expresses all
this. Yet, for the sin of man, it repented God that He
had made this glorious order; and this it was which
perished. The earth was not destroyed; it only
received again that covering of primeval waters which,
at God's word, had retired and let the dry land appear.
At the same word both earth and heaven combined to
destroy the goodliness with which creation was adorned.
For, on the day of the Deluge (Gen. vii. 11), all the
fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the
windows of heaven were opened, and the waters came
again to cover the earth. They prevailed exceedingly,
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth; even
the fowls and the moving creatures, which had been
brought forth from the teeming waters, perished, and
all things were destroyed from off the earth. Thus
does St. Peter lay bare the unwisdom of those who will
not listen to, who are wilfully forgetful of, the parables
of God's word, who close their eyes to His judgements,
sent that by them men may learn righteousness.</p>

<p><em>But the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the
same word have been stored up for fire.</em> The Apostle
now turns away from what the Old Testament Scriptures
relate as history of the past to what the same
records teach us concerning the future; and he deals
partly with promise, partly with prophecy. The earth
will not be destroyed again by a deluge. God hath
made His covenant: "I will establish My covenant
with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by
the waters of a flood, neither shall there any more be
a flood to destroy the earth" (Gen. ix. 11). But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
will be a judgement; and then not, as in the days of
Noah, will the &#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;, the beautiful order of nature,
alone be destroyed, but heaven and earth alike shall be
involved in the common overthrow. Here the Apostle
is but the expositor of the words of psalmists and
prophets of the older times. He who sang, "Of old
Thou hast laid the foundation of the earth, and the
heavens are the work of Thy hands," was inspired to
add, "They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure;
yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment: as a
vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall be
changed" (Psalm cii. 25). Isaiah, the evangelist among
the prophets, saw more, and connects this mighty change
with the day of the Lord's vengeance: "Then shall all
the host of heaven be dissolved, and the heavens shall
be rolled together as a scroll" (Isa. xxxiv. 4); and in
another place he foresees how "the heavens shall vanish
away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a
garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like
manner, ... for Mine arms shall judge the people"
(Isa. li. 6); and yet again in more solemn wise, "The
Lord will come with fire, and with His chariots
like a whirlwind, to render His anger with fury and
His rebuke with names of fire, for by fire and by His
sword will the Lord plead with all flesh" (Isa. lxvi. 15).
And this he proclaims as the preparation for "the
new heavens and the new earth which He will make."
Daniel also tells us of God's "throne of judgement to
be set, which is like the fiery flame, and His wheels
as burning fire" (Dan. vii. 9).</p>

<p>With such light from the lamp of prophecy, the
Apostle in his exegesis proclaims the nature of the final
judgement. Like other New Testament writers, he has
attained, since the day of Pentecost, a deeper insight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
and a firmer grasp of the purport of what Moses in the
Law and the prophets did write. We can see how on
that very day thoughts like these which he expresses
in his letter were borne in upon his mind. For not
only does he apply the prophecy of Joel to the events
which then struck the multitude with wonder, but he
carries on the lesson further to the coming of the great
and notable day of the Lord, and reminds his hearers
that then God "will show wonders in heaven above and
signs in the earth beneath, blood and fire and vapour
of smoke, when the sun shall be turned into darkness,
and the moon into blood" (Acts ii. 19). And the like
illumination had been bestowed on St. Paul. For he
too tells (1 Cor. iii. 13) of a day when each man's
work shall be proved by fire; and more definitely he
assures the Thessalonians, to whom he wrote much
concerning the day of the Lord, that there will come a
"revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the
angels of His power in flaming fire, rendering vengeance
to them that know not God, and to them that obey not
the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ" (2 Thess. i. 8).</p>

<p>In such wise did the Apostles read the utterances of
prophecy; and thus did they apply them as lessons for
their own and all future times. They felt that not unto
themselves, but unto us, did the prophets minister. And
St. Peter does but put their message into his own
words when in his bold figure he says that the heavens
that now are and the earth are stored up for fire.</p>

<p>The Revised Version on its margin renders the last
words "stored with fire." And when we reflect on the
storing of the waters at the Creation, afterwards to be
let forth to destroy the world which hitherto they had
made fruitful and lovely, the parallelism is very suggestive.
God has stored the earth within with fire, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
from time to time makes its mighty presence and power
for destruction known. The visitations of earthquakes
may therefore well remind us that He who used the
treasures of waters in the Deluge for His ministers may
in like manner hereafter employ this treasury of fire.</p>

<p><em>Being reserved against the day of judgement and destruction
of ungodly men.</em> When God no longer waits
for sinners to repent, then will come the judgement and
destruction of the ungodly. At that day the heavens
that now are and the earth shall be exchanged or
transformed. God will prepare a new heaven and a
new earth wherein the righteous may find a congenial
home with their Lord. Here they can never be other
than pilgrims and sojourners, seeking to be clothed
upon with their house which is from heaven. What
the destruction of the ungodly shall be we can only
judge and speak of in the terms of Scripture. The
language of St. Paul to the Thessalonians seems to
teach us that the very advent of the Judge shall bring
their penalty: "They shall suffer punishment, even
eternal destruction" (the word is not the same which
St. Peter uses) "from the face of the Lord and from
the glory of His might" (2 Thess. i. 9), in the presence
of which nothing that is defiled can dwell. So God,
of His mercy, still reserves the heavens and the earth,
and thus to every new generation offers His mercy,
saying continually through their silent witness, in the
spirit in which He spake to Israel at the close of
the volume of prophecy, "I am Jehovah"&mdash;that is, the
merciful and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in
goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity, transgression, and sin&mdash;"I change not;
therefore ye sinners are not destroyed."</p>

<h3><em>THE LORD IS NOT SLACK</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the
Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The
Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness;
but is long-suffering to youward, not wishing that any should perish,
but that all should come to repentance."&mdash;<span class="smcap">2 Peter</span> iii. 8, 9.</p></blockquote>


<p>"All things continue as they were from the
from the beginning of the creation," said the mockers.
It was foolish therefore to believe in, or to think of,
a judgement to come. In the words before us the
Apostle not only supplies an answer to the scorners,
but gives a precious lesson to Christians for all time
on the nature of God and His government of the
world. It is but a single thought, but when the mind
of the believer has grasped its significance, he will
look out upon the world untroubled. No mockery
will disturb his faith.</p>

<p><em>But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is
with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years
as one day.</em> Here the Apostle quotes some words from
that psalm (xc.) which is entitled "A Prayer of Moses,
the Man of God." In it the Psalmist is contrasting
God's eternity with the frailty of man and the shortness
of human life. "A thousand years in Thy sight are
but as yesterday when it is past." But St. Peter not
only adopts, but adapts, the words for his own purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
He wants to teach the Christians in their trials that,
while what is long in man's estimation may in God's
providence be counted but little, yet through God's
decree what to man appears little may be big with
mightiest consequences. He therefore first inverts
the words of the Psalmist. One day is with the Lord
as a thousand years, while a thousand years may be
as one day. One day of His deluge swept a whole
generation out of the world, while His day of Pentecost
remains potent in the history of His grace for all the
ages which are yet to come. Through a mistaken
literalness, men have sometimes expounded the lesson
as if Jehovah's dealings were a question of arithmetic.
Nothing could be farther from the Apostle's thought,
who would have us know that of great and little God's
work makes no account. With Him there is no short
or long in time. What He does is not to be measured
by the petty standards of humanity.</p>

<p>Men <em>must</em> take note of time, for they feel its lapse
and its loss. They are ever conscious that a period
is coming after which what is undone must continue
undone. Again, the length of time is known to them
by the recurrence of the various acts of life, and by
the weariness which comes of continued labour, and
by the grief of protracted waiting. These things force
them to speak of short and long, but with God it is
not so. For Him all time is one. He knows nothing
of toil. Whatsoever He pleaseth, that doeth He in
heaven and in earth, in the sea and in all deep places
(Psalm cxxxv. 6). The Psalmist had attained a true
conception. The whole world and all worlds were in
His control, and their order the working of His eternal
will. He needs no rest; He slumbereth not, nor
sleepeth. To Him there is no waiting, no weariness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Hence the past, the present, and the future are for
Him one unbroken now.</p>

<p>This is the one thing which the Apostle offers to
the Christian brethren for their support and consolation
against the scoffers. And the knowledge is mighty
for those who grasp it. It helps them to cast themselves
securely upon the almighty arms, convinced
that God's working is not to be estimated according
to man's days and years, but is certain in its effect.
One generation passeth away, and another cometh; but
death, they learn, does not take men out of the
knowledge or the hand of God, be it for mercy they
are reserved, or for judgement. God does not defer
His action because He lacks power to perform, neither
does He tarry because He is unmindful of His servants
or insensible to what they endure.</p>

<p>Such thoughts can minister to the faithful abundant
consolation, and this was the desire of the Apostle.
But they raise for all time large questions which can
find no answer here, questions concerning the lot of
those who pass from this brief day of life into the
eternal world and have not known God's will, that
they might do it; questions concerning a discipline
which may yet be reserved for some who have not
bent themselves to it here, perhaps from want of light;
questions of how far hope may extend itself beyond
the veil which divides this world from the next. Such
questions rise within many earnest souls, often rather
for the sake of others than themselves; but God has
vouchsafed us no answer, lest men should wax presumptuous.</p>

<p><em>The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some
count slackness.</em> Many things conspire to make the
doings of men to tarry. At one time pledges are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
given beyond what foresight would warrant; and when
the day of performance arrives, they are forced to
plead that events have falsified their expectation, and
they cannot do the things that they would. Again,
men, with the most earnest zeal, attempt a work
beyond their powers, and of necessity have to delay
the fulfilment of their promises; while some are taken
away untimely from the midst of their fellows, ere life
has enabled them to achieve what they counted on
once as certain. Want of knowledge, of time, and
of power is the heritage of the sons of men; and
therewith conspires not seldom a change of mind and
consequent want of will. But He with whom is no
variableness, the omnipotent, omniscient, eternal Lord
of all, is subject to no hindrance. Whether events
appear to men to linger or to be sudden, all move
under the control of the same unchanging will. He
is not slack, as men are slack, either to rescue the
righteous or to punish the ungodly. Of this the son
of Sirach spake: "The Lord will not be slack, neither
will the Almighty be patient, ... till He have taken
away the multitude of the proud and broken the sceptre
of the unrighteous, ... till He have judged the cause
of His people and made them to rejoice in His mercy"
(Ecclus. xxxv. 18).</p>

<p>Here is a medicine for fainting souls, of whom there
must have been many among these Asian Christians.
And it is a solace furnished, too, by the teachings of
prophecy. "The vision," says one, "is yet for an
appointed time" (Hab. iii. 3). God's will has ordered
when and how it shall be accomplished; all moves by
His decree. "At the end it shall speak, and not lie."
There is no disappointment to those who wait upon
the purposes of God. "Though it tarry, wait for it,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
even though the waiting may last beyond this life,
"because it will surely come; it will not tarry. The
just shall live by his faith."</p>

<p>The order of the words in the original (&#8001; &#954;&#8059;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962;
&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#8055;&#945;&#962;) and the unwonted construction of the verb,
of which no other example is forthcoming, have
suggested to some to render thus: "The Lord of the
promise is not slack." Even so the words give a
powerful sense. God, who makes the promise to men,
is supreme over all on which its faithfulness depends,
supreme both as Maker and Fulfiller of His word. He
sees and controls the end from the beginning. Blessed
are all they that put their trust in Him.</p>

<p><em>But is long-suffering to youward.</em> The Authorised
Version heads "to usward". And some have thought
it more in accord with the Apostle's manner and
humility to include himself with the brethren. The
other reading is better supported, and none will doubt
on that account St. Peter's sense of God's long-suffering
towards himself. The term which he here employs
to describe the Divine character implies the holding
back of wrath. God might justly punish, but He stays
His blow. Men have sinned, and still sin; but His love
prevails above His anger. The word is formed by the
LXX. translators to render one expression in that
passage (Exod. xxxiv. 6) where God proclaims unto
Moses the attributes by which He would be known
unto men. Through all the list mercy is the dominant
feature. Term upon term seems devised to magnify
the tenderness of Jehovah towards His people, though
at last, if the continual offers of mercy are despised,
He "will by no means clear the guilty." No other
language furnishes such a word, for no other people
had such a knowledge of the God of all grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Not wishing that any should perish, but that all should
come to repentance.</em> We are wont to connect statements
like this with the gracious messages of the New Testament.
Yet some saints of earlier time felt all that
St. Peter here teaches. The writer of Ecclesiasticus
has some striking words. He is connecting God's mercy
with the shortness of man's life, and his language anticipates
in the main this teaching of the Apostle: "The
number of a man's days at the most are a hundred years.
As a drop of water unto the sea, so are a thousand
years to the days of eternity. Therefore is God patient
with them, and poureth forth His mercy upon them.
The mercy of man is toward his neighbour, but the
mercy of God is upon all flesh; He reproveth, and
nurtureth, and teacheth, and bringeth again as a shepherd
his flock" (Ecclus. xviii. 9-14). In such wise had
some who waited for the consolation of Israel grasped
God's promises by anticipation, seeing them afar off and
being persuaded of them. Such men owned themselves,
equally with the Apostle, to be strangers and pilgrims,
and sought for that inheritance which Christ sent him
to preach.</p>

<p>The word "wishing" (&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;) implies deliberate
consent. This God does not give to the death of any
sinner. If any perish, it is not because God so desired
or designed. But some will ask, "Why, then, should
any perish?" St. Peter in this sentence, full of grace,
supplies the answer. They continue in sin, and repent
not. Even offers of mercy are of no avail. But why
does not the Almighty Father drive them to repentance
by His judgements? Because He has made His children
free, and asks from them a willing service. They are
to <em>come</em> to repentance. The invitation is full and free.
Christ says, "Come unto Me, all ye that labour." Nay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
God makes at times a less demand: "Look unto Me
and be ye saved, all ye ends of the earth." Could
words breathe more of mercy? To come, to look&mdash;that
is the sole demand. God bestows all besides. Let
men but manifest a desire, and His grace is poured
forth. He wisheth not that any should perish.</p>

<p>And Christ, too, when He speaks of the gifts of the
Holy Spirit, has the same lesson. The Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost all conspire to further the
work of man's salvation. "All things," said our Lord,
"whatsoever the Father hath, are Mine. Therefore said
I, He shall take of Mine, and shall show" (R.V. declare)
"it unto you." But the eye to see what He shows, the
ear to hear His declarations&mdash;these He asks from men.
He willeth that they should <em>come</em> to repentance, and
through that gate should come to Him.</p>

<p>The Apostle, ever earnest to put the brethren in
mind of the things they had heard or read, never
fails to follow his own precept. His thoughts perpetually
go back to the words of Jesus, of which the
passage before us is but one example out of many.
"If the master of the house had known in what hour
the thief was coming, he would have watched" (Luke
xii. 39). So spake Christ to the disciples when urging
them to be like unto servants that look for the coming
of their lord. To the Master's parable St. Peter now
gives its application: <em>But the day of the Lord will come
as a thief</em>. He means first to mark the unexpected
advent, which steals upon men when they least think
of it. Sinners will have lulled themselves into security,
and the thought farthest from their minds will be the
all-important preparation. St. Paul uses the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
figure in speaking of the same subject (1 Thess. v. 2),
from which passage the words "in the night" have
found their way into the text of St. Peter, to which,
as the Revised Version indicates, they do not belong.
And in the Epistle to the Hebrews the Apostle has
defined the preparation which, joined with patience,
should keep men in readiness for the certain advent:
"Exhorting one another, and so much the more as ye
see the day approaching" (Heb. x. 25).</p>

<p>St. Peter passes on to tell of the terrors which shall
attend on that day. Here also he has in mind the
words of his Master, who, after a prophecy of the
destruction of Jerusalem, spake of that greater coming
of the Son of man of which the overthrow of the Holy
City was to be but a partial type: "There shall be signs
in sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth distress
of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea
and the billows, men fainting for fear and for expectation
of the things that are coming on the world, for the
powers of the heavens shall be shaken" (Luke xxi. 25;
Matt. xxiv. 29). With the Lord's language for his
warrant, he paints, largely in the words of the prophets
of old, the things which shall befall the world in that
great and notable day: <em>In the which the heavens shall
pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall be
dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works
that are therein shall be burned up</em>. Isaiah had used
like words of old: "All the host of heaven shall be
dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as
a scroll" (Isa. xxxiv. 4); and in another place he speaks
(xxiv. 19) of the earth as utterly broken, clean dissolved,
moved exceedingly; Micah has to proclaim the coming
of the Lord, and he pictures it thus: "The mountains
shall be molten under Him, and the valleys shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
cleft as wax before the fire" (Micah i. 4); and Nahum,
describing the day of the Lord which he foresaw was
coming upon Nineveh, says, "The mountains quake
at Him, and the hills melt; and the earth is upheaved
at His presence, yea the world and all that dwell
therein." It is St. Peter's, by the light of the words
of Jesus, to read their full purport into these prophetic
messages, and to teach those upon whom the ends
of the ages are come that all these things will have
their consummation in that coming of the Lord which
shall be the close of these latter days.</p>

<p>When thus considered his description contains many
striking details. "The heavens will pass away."
Christ Himself had so spoken, not of heaven only,
but of the earth also. His word was the same which
Peter employs, but He used it in the same sentence
thus: "My word will not pass away" (Matt. xxiv. 35).
That is the one thing to which we may trust. All else
will be destroyed or changed. Only those who are in
Christ will be fit for the new order. For them old
things are passed away; behold, they are become new
(2 Cor. v. 17). They have been purified by the fire
of the Holy Spirit, and so can abide the day of Christ's
coming.</p>

<p>To describe the dread process he has a striking
word, which, like so many of the Apostle's expressions,
is used nowhere else in the New Testament: "With
a great noise" (&#8165;&#959;&#953;&#950;&#951;&#948;&#8057;&#957;). It is applied to many sounds
of terror: to the hurtling of weapons as they fly
through the air; to the sound of a lash as it is brought
down for the blow; to the rushing of waters; to the
hissing of serpents. He has chosen it as if by it he
would unite many horrors in one.</p>

<p>Then the thought of nature's dissolution. All that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
was bound together at the Creation, and then received
a law of cohesion which sustained it thenceforth, will be
cast loose, the compacted world dissolved. These
things have been thought of as emblems of stability.
God hath made the round world so fast that it cannot
be moved (Psalm civ. 5), but He who made can also
unmake. How foolish then must they be who bound
their thoughts and aims by what the world can give,
making themselves thereby of the earth, earthy, and so
sure to fail when that is destroyed. And what are
those works that are in the earth of which the Apostle
speaks? Do the words mean no more than "the
world and all that therein is," a phrase so common in
Scripture? At first sight it appears so. But some
most ancient manuscripts, instead of "shall be burned
up," read "shall be discovered." Of this the Revised
Version takes note on its margin. From this reading
the mind goes to the words of the Preacher, "God
shall bring every work into judgement, with every hidden
thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil" (Eccles.
xii. 14). The sense is thus bound closer with the
coming of the day of the Lord.</p>

<p><em>Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved,
what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy living
and godliness?</em> The Apostle says more than "are to
be dissolved." His word signifies "are being dissolved."
The event is so sure, and the interests
involved so weighty, that he speaks of it as present,
that thus he may more forcibly urge his lesson of
preparation. "What manner of persons ought ye to
be?" Christ had supplied the answer, and so St. Peter
gives none: "Let your loins be girded about, and your
lamps burning, and ye yourselves like unto men looking
for their lord" (Luke xii. 25). The figures imply readiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
for any service, most of all, to an Eastern mind,
readiness to set forth on a journey. Such should ever
be the attitude of those who are but sojourners and
pilgrims. And by his words the Apostle intimates how
this preparedness should enter into every relation of
the Christian life. The translation says, "in <em>all</em> holy
living and godliness"; but in the Greek there is no
word for <em>all</em>. Literally the words are "in holy conversations
and godlinesses." In English we could not
use words thus. Hence the device of the translators
to come as near to the sense as is possible. But if we
carry with us the thought contained in these plural
words, we see how St. Peter teaches by them that in
our daily life and work as well as in our religious
exercises we should be ever watchful, ever ready. Our
life with men and with God should be stamped as
"Holiness unto the Lord." By such a walk we shall
keep ourselves apart from sinners, and be helped thus
far to keep away from sin. And the godliness of
which he speaks springs, as he has already taught
(i. 6) in this Epistle, from a patient waiting on the
Lord. Thus the whole attitude of the Christian
becomes one of wakeful readiness. He is of those of
whom it is said, "Blessed are those servants whom
their lord when he cometh shall find watching."</p>

<p><em>Looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day
of God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire shall
be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat.</em>
The question of the mockers, "Where is the promise
of His coming?" will not disturb those whose lives are
thus made ready. That coming fills their every thought,
moulds every desire, controls and chastens every action.
For not only do they look for it: they long for it, and
earnestly desire it. For to be with Christ is far better.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
Hence they hear of the melting elements and the fires
of heaven without alarm. With them it is as with
the Hebrew children in the days of Nebuchadnezzar.
The fires which others dread, and by reason of which
the heavens dissolve and the elements melt, will have
no power over them save to loose their bonds, to free
them from the burden of the flesh, to further that
change from the natural to the spiritual which St. Paul
teaches we must all undergo; while with them there
will be the Son of God. And thus they will attain to
their desire, and become partakers of the Divine nature.</p>

<p>But the translation "earnestly desiring" by no means
exhausts the significance and solemnity of St. Peter's
word. The Authorised Version rendered it "hasting
unto the coming of the day of God"; but the word
"unto" is not in the Greek, though the verb means
"hastening." The word is found in the LXX. of
Isa. xvi. 5, where the Authorised Version translates
the Hebrew by "hasting righteousness" and the
Revised by "swift to do righteousness." But though
a king, as in that passage, may be said to hasten righteousness
by being swift to do it, is there any sense in
which men could be said to hasten the coming of the
day of God? It seems as though Christ intended to
set such an aim before His servants. Before He was
crucified He spake that prophetic promise, "I, if I be
lifted up, will draw all men unto Me." When He had
been lifted up on the cross and as a testimony to His
Godhead, lifted up from the grave, He gave His commission
to the Apostles: "Go ye therefore and make
disciples of all the nations.... Lo, I am with you
alway, even unto the end of the world." He promised
His Spirit also to be their Guide into all truth.</p>

<p>Thus were they sent to be heralds of and labourers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
for his kingdom; and one of them has testified to the
abundance of the aid bestowed: "I can do all things
through Christ that giveth me power." But he who
thus spake could say to his converts, "Be ye imitators
of me, even as I also am of Christ" (1 Cor. xi. 1). In
this way men can lift up Christ; in this way can they
draw men to Him. And to do this by examples of holy
living and godliness is the work which He has committed
to His Church, to let the light of Christian
lives shine before men in such wise that they may be
won for Him. And when we see His kingdom's slow
advance, St. Peter's question is turned into a reproach,
"What manner of men ought ye to be?"</p>

<p><em>But, according to His promise, we look for new
heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</em>
All creation was marred at the Fall. It groaneth and
travaileth until now in pain along with the sons of
men. It was made subject unto vanity, but that was
by reason of God, who made it thus subject in hope
that it shall be delivered, along with man, from the
bondage of corruption. And that victory was promised
from the first. The seed of the woman shall not
always be the spoil of the serpent. The world was in
many ways kept alive to this thought. A race was
promised from whom all nations should be blessed.
God established a kingdom to represent His rule in the
world, and at length Isaiah was inspired to tell of new
heavens and a new earth (Isa. lxv. 17). He too
foresaw that this was for a reign of righteousness,
that it pointed to a time when the wickedness of the
wicked had come to an end: "The sun shall be no
more thy light by day, neither the moon by night; for
the Lord shall be thy everlasting light, and as for thy
people, they shall all be righteous." And Christ while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
on earth endorsed the prophetic word: "I go to prepare
a place for you. I will come again and receive you
unto Myself, that where I am, there shall My servant
be."</p>

<p>Hence St. Peter says, "According to His promise we
look forward." And by using the same he identifies
the new heavens and the new earth with the coming of
the day of God. The believer heeds no more the
mockers who ask, "Where is the promise of His
coming?" He can look and lift up his head, assured
that his redemption draweth nigh. For his expectation
has been fostered through a life of holy conversation
and godliness, and the assurance of the day of God is
firm, for the kingdom of God is set up within him.</p>

<p>And the consolation of the promise consists largely
in the thought that in the new creation righteousness
will dwell, will make its home. First, there will be
Christ the righteous, who is also our righteousness;
and all the hindrances and stumbling-blocks of this life
will be removed. Here the sojourners and pilgrims
abide for the time amid many foes and countless perils;
then they will be delivered even from their own
frailties. As their home is new-created, so they shall
become new creatures. So their thought, their prayer,
their struggle, is ever, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sursum corda</i>; and day by day
they are bound less to earth and realise more of heaven.</p>

<h2><a name="XXX" id="XXX">XXX</a></h2>

<h3>"<em>BE YE STEDFAST, UNMOVABLE.</em>"</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these things, give
diligence that ye may be found in peace, without spot and blameless
in His sight. And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is
salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the
wisdom given to him, wrote unto you; as also in all <em>his</em> epistles,
speaking in them of these things; wherein are some things hard to
be understood, which the ignorant and unstedfast wrest, as <em>they do</em>
also the other Scriptures, unto their own destruction. Ye therefore,
beloved, knowing <em>these things</em> beforehand, beware lest, being carried
away with the error of the wicked, ye fall from your own stedfastness.
But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ. To Him <em>be</em> the glory both now and for ever. Amen."&mdash;<span class="smcap">2
Peter</span> iii. 14-18.</p></blockquote>


<p>In these solemn closing words the Apostle sums up
his exhortations and warnings. His admonition is
of a twofold character. First, he urges the brethren to
strive after stedfastness, but to beware of sinking into
a careless security which may make them an easy
prey to false guides. "Stand fast," he would say, "and
be ever watchful against falling." Then, let your Christian
life be one of steady, constant, temperate progress;
let it imitate God's works in nature, which wax, man
sees not how or when, by drawing constantly from the
hidden sources which minister life and increase. Let
believers seek thus that in their lives there may grow
from God's seed of faith first the blade, then the ear,
then the full corn in the ear, to yield some thirty, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
sixty, some a hundredfold, to the praise and glory of
the Lord of the harvest.</p>

<p><em>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these things,
give diligence that ye may be found in peace, without spot
and blameless in His sight.</em> The whole passage runs
over with Christian affection; a very working out it
is in a believer's life of Christ's teaching, "By this
shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye love
one another." Love to the brethren, love to his fellow-apostle,
breathes in every line of these final sentences.
Beloved are the Churches, beloved his fellow-labourer.
And he is never weary of repeating that word "looking
for," which marks the true attitude of the Christian
pilgrim: Seeing that ye look for the coming of the
day of God. Before he had said, <em>We</em> look for it; now
he brings the lesson nearer home to every one of them:
<em>Ye</em> are looking for these things. Be ye therefore ready.
Give diligence that ye may be found in peace by Christ
when He appears.</p>

<p>Peace is the bond which clasps together the brotherhood
of Christ. But things which need a bond are
prone to break asunder, and St. Paul marks the care
which is needed in this matter by using the same word
(&#963;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#8049;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;) which St. Peter employs here. And his
list of the virtues which make for peace shows how
much anxiety is needed: "With all lowliness and
meekness, with long-suffering forbearing one another in
love, <em>giving diligence</em> to keep the unity of the Spirit in
the bond of peace" (Eph. iv. 2). Such are the graces
to be fostered by those who look for the Lord's coming.
The Hebrew knew no nobler word to use for blessing
than "Peace be with you." Christ at His parting says
to His disciples, "My peace I leave with you; My peace
I give unto you." It embraces reconciliation with God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and union with the brethren; it is a treasure worthy
of all striving for, and when attained it passeth all
understanding.</p>

<p>They who are looking for Christ will strive to become
like Him. Christ came down from heaven and assumed
humanity that His brethren might take courage for
this lofty aim. The Apostle (1 Peter i. 19) has spoken
of Him as a lamb without spot and blemish, and this
ideal purity he now sets before the brethren. For he
knows that to strive after it will sunder them from the
corruptions of those false teachers whom he has called
"spots and blemishes" (ii. 13) in the Christian society.
Instead of denying the Master that bought them, they
will be hearkening constantly for His voice. Thus will
they become clean through the word which He speaks
unto them (John xv. 3). For His voice is ever helpful;
and abiding in Him, they will bring forth much fruit.</p>

<p><em>And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is
salvation.</em> The mockers had made the delay of God's
day the subject of their scoffing. "It tarries," said they,
"because it is never coming." Their speech was, in
fact, a challenge: "If it is to come, let it come now."
The Christian is of another mind. His heart is full
of thankfulness for the mercy which allows time for that
diligence which his preparation demands. St. Paul
expresses this feeling concerning God's dealings with
himself: "For this cause I obtained mercy, that in
me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all His
long-suffering, for an example of them which should
hereafter believe on Him unto eternal life" (1 Tim. i. 16).
And the opportunity thus granted him that Apostle
used to the full; yet ever mindful was he not only from
whom was the mercy, but also from whom came the
power which was with him in his diligence: "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but
the grace of God which was with me." And in another
place (Phil. i. 22), though he longs to be released from
life and to be with Christ, he recognises that there may
be a Divine purpose in delaying <em>that</em> day of God also,
that to live in the flesh may be the fruit of his labour;
and if this be so, he is content.</p>

<p>For the believer thinks not only of his own salvation
and his own opportunities. The Christian's faith is
not selfish. He beholds how large a part of the world
is not yet subject unto Christ, and owns in the delay
of the day of the Lord a wealth of abundant grace,
offering salvation still to all who will accept it.</p>

<p><em>Even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to
the wisdom given to him, wrote unto you.</em> Some, who
have restricted the allusion of St. Peter here to the
"long-suffering" of God, have thought that the Epistle
to the Romans is intended. That letter is the only one
in which St. Paul speaks generally on this subject.
In ii. 4 he asks, "Despisest thou the riches of God's
goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not
knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
repentance?" and, again, asks another question:
"What if God, willing to show His wrath and to make
His power known, endured with much long-suffering
vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction, and that He
might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels
of mercy?" (ix. 22). Others, considering the great
subject of the day of God to be specially present to
St. Peter's mind, have found parallels in the two
epistles to the Thessalonians. It has also been
pointed out that Silvanus was with St. Paul when
these letters were written, and that through him
(1 Peter v. 12) their import might have been brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
the knowledge of the Asiatic congregations. But we
know too little of the intercommunication of the
Churches of Europe and Asia to arrive at a conclusion,
while the definite statement "wrote unto you" seems
certainly to refer to some letter addressed to the
Churches of Asia. Among these, beside the Galatians,
were the Ephesians and the Colossians. Reference
has already been made to the way in which St. Paul
speaks in his first epistle to Timothy of the long-suffering
of God towards himself. Would the letter to
the bishop of Ephesus be held too personal for its contents
in some form to be imparted to the whole Church?
Then in the Ephesian epistle such a passage as ii. 4-7
may well have been in St. Peter's thoughts: "God,
being rich in mercy, ... quickened us together with
Christ, ... that in the ages to come He might show
the exceeding riches of His grace in kindness towards
us in Jesus Christ," or Col. i. 19, 20: "It was the
good pleasure of the Father that in Him should all
the fulness dwell, and through Him to reconcile all
things unto Himself, having made peace through the
blood of His cross." But there is no reason from St.
Peter's words to assume that he is referring to an
extant epistle. He may have known of a letter to the
brethren in Asia of which we have no trace. Of one
thing we may be sure: that his words had a definite
sense for those to whom they were written.</p>

<p>But his reference to St. Paul has much interest for
other reasons. Among these brethren there would be
current many memories of the great Apostle to whose
labour the formation of these Churches was chiefly due.
His name would for them add weight to St. Peter's
admonitions. The mention of the wisdom Divinely
given to him would remind the Galatians at least how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
foolish had been their doubts and waverings in bygone
days. While, as they knew how one apostle had
withstood the other when he saw that he was to be
blamed, such words as these from St. Peter would
come with double force. Most of all, while the
teachers of error were perverting St. Paul's language
for an occasion to the flesh, it was good that the
Churches should be reminded that he ever taught men
to strive after lives without spot and blemish and had
given no licence to the excesses for which his words
were offered as a warrant.</p>

<p><em>As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these
things.</em> From this it appears that it is the whole drift
of St. Peter's letter, its warnings as well as its counsels,
which is in harmony with the words of St. Paul. But
we need not assume that St. Peter's readers were
acquainted with all the fellow-Apostle's writings. He
is telling them what his own experience has proved.</p>

<p><em>Wherein are some things hard to be understood, which
the ignorant and unstedfast wrest, as they do also the
other Scriptures, unto their own destruction.</em> This passage
is noteworthy as the only place in the New Testament
in which the writings of the Apostles are regarded as
ranking with the Scriptures of the old covenant.
Everywhere else "Scripture" means the Old Testament.
Yet, as the Apostles were passing away, it
must have begun to be felt that a time was coming
when great authority would attach to their words, as
of persons who had seen the Lord. St. Peter has just
spoken of the wisdom which was given to St. Paul.
That wisdom came from the same source as the
illumination of the prophets; and it is not unnatural,
after such an allusion, that his writings should be
classed with those of old time. Both were subjected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
to the same treatment. So perversely had the Old
Testament been read that when He came of whom it
spake&mdash;came to those who held the volume in their
hands, and who regarded it with much show of reverence&mdash;He
was not recognised. His people had blinded
their eyes. Just so was it faring with that "freedom"
of which St. Paul had said so much to the Galatian
Church. Wrested from its true meaning, it was put
forward as if it gave warranty and encouragement for
the life of the libertine.</p>

<p>That many things in the writings of St. Paul are
difficult to comprehend is beyond question. He more
than any of the New Testament writers works out the
principles of Christ's teaching in their consequences.
He deals most fully with the great questions which
circle round the doctrine of redemption; with election
and justification; with the casting off of God's ancient
people and the certainty of their restoration; with the
objects of faith, the things hoped for, but as yet unseen;
with the resurrection of the body and the changes
which shall pass upon it; and with the nature of the
life to come. He of all men realised to the full the
length, and breadth, and depth, and height of the love
of God, and spake in his letters of much which passeth
knowledge.</p>

<p>But in St. Peter's word (&#948;&#965;&#963;&#957;&#8057;&#951;&#964;&#945;) "hard to be
understood" there appears to be the thought that men's
difficulties arise in part because they look on these
subjects as studies for the intellect (&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;) alone, and
fail for this reason to attain to the best knowledge
which is given to man. It is of God's order that for
the lessons which come from Him He also imparts the
power of true discernment. Those who approach the
study of Christian truth as a cold intellectual exercise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
in the comprehension of which heart and soul bear no
part, will go away empty, and as dark almost as they
come.</p>

<p>The "wresting" of which St. Peter here speaks may
come either of the misuse of single terms, just as the
apostles of licence put a wrong sense, for their own ends,
on St. Paul's "liberty," or it may be the effect of severing
a lesson from its occasion and its context. Such perversion
also happened to St. Paul's doctrine. To those
who, like the Galatians, had been drawn back to an
undue estimate of the legal ordinances of Judaism, the
Apostle, as a corrective, had exalted faith far above
outward observances; and there soon arose those who
under his language sheltered themselves in a dissolute
Antinomianism. The same befell in later days when
Agricola and the Solifidians perverted Luther's teaching
of justification by faith. And when such misleading
guides find hearers who are "ignorant and unstedfast,"
the false lessons, which always have the frailties
of humanity to back them, gain many adherents.
To the thoughtless such teaching is seductive, and is
unsuspected because it puts on a semblance of affinity
with truth. Hence grow those ruptures of the Christian
body, those heresies which lead to destruction
(ii. 1).</p>

<p><em>Ye therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand,
beware lest, being carried away with the error of the wicked,
ye fall from your own stedfastness.</em> In the first chapter
the Apostle has already (ver. 12) addressed the converts
as those who knew the things of which he wrote and
needed only to be put in mind, who were established
in the truth, and not to be classed with the ignorant and
unstedfast. Yet for all there is need of watchfulness.
The lies which are abroad clothe themselves in the garb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
of truth, wresting the Scriptures. "Therefore," says
he, "guard yourselves" (&#966;&#965;&#955;&#8049;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949;). The word is not
only a notice against dangers from without, but an
admonition to watchfulness within. The wandering of
the lawless may beguile; to many it has attractions.
But if they join that company and follow with them,
the end will be a shipwreck of the whole Christian life.
The verb (&#7952;&#954;&#960;&#8055;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;) is that which we find (Acts xxvii.
26, 29) in the description of the wreck at Melita, when
the sailors feared lest they should be cast ashore
on rocky ground. It is against a moral peril of even
more terrible character that St. Peter warns the
Churches; and the contrast is most instructive which
is pictured in the two words by which he defines error
and stedfastness. The former (&#960;&#955;&#8049;&#957;&#951;) betokens a
ceaseless wandering, a life without a plan, a voyage
without rudder or compass, every stage made in doubt,
uncertainty, and peril; the other word (&#963;&#964;&#951;&#961;&#965;&#947;&#956;&#8056;&#962;)
tells of firmness, fixity, and strength, and comes fitly
into the exhortation of that Apostle whose charge was,
"When thou art converted, strengthen" (&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#958;&#959;&#957;) "thy
brethren" (Luke xxii. 32). "This stedfastness," he
says, "is now your own" (&#7984;&#948;&#7984;&#959;&#965;); "barter it not away
for any illusions of wayward error."</p>

<p><em>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ.</em> As if to attest his own stedfastness;
he ends as he had begun. "Grace unto you and
peace be multiplied," was the opening greeting of his first
letter, to which in his second he adds, "through the
knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord." But there
is great significance in the way in which St. Peter's
words hang together in this verse. The structure of
the sentence shows that he intends to say not only
that grace is the gift of Jesus Christ, but that from Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
comes also all knowledge that is worthy of the name,
a lesson most fitting and most necessary in those days,
when teachers, who claimed to be possessors of a
special higher knowledge, were denying Jesus altogether
both as Master and as Judge. "Root yourselves in
Christ," is the apostolic charge; "seek His help; walk
by His light. Thus only can your power increase; thus
only can your way be safe."</p>

<p><em>To Him be the glory both now and for ever. Amen.</em>
This is the end of the Apostles labour: that Christ may
be glorified in His servants; that they may know Him
here as the Way, the Truth, and the Life, hereafter as
the High-priest of His people, but deigning to become
the First-born among many brethren. For those who
find Him here and there also eternity will be too short
to show forth all His praise.</p>
